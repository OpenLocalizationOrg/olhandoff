In Hadoop deployments, our solutions inspect incoming data\nand protect it before it is stored. These capabilities simplify risk\nmanagement, improve operational efficiencies, and reduce regulatory\ncompliance costs.\n\n![](media/hdinsight-application-partners/datatorrent2.png)  \nAs a native Hadoop solution, DataTorrent enables you to leverage your\nexisting Hadoop environment for real-time stream analytics on a massive\nscale. Processing billions of events per second with sub-second latency,\nDataTorrent supports today’s most demanding, mission-critical, big-data\napplications.\n\nCommon use cases include processing machine-data for the Internet of\nThings, fraud detection in financial services, log analysis and IT\noperations, Geo-location services, Social apps, and more.\n\n![](media/hdinsight-application-partners/datameer3.png)  \nDatameer’s end-to-end Big Data Discovery solution enables business users\nto discover insights in any data via wizard-based data integration,\niterative point-and-click analytics, and drag-and-drop visualizations,\nregardless of the data type, size, or source.\n\nOptimized for big data analytical workloads characterized by multiple\ndata sources of varying types, Datameer uses Hortonworks Data Platform\nfor both storage and compute, and is a fully extensible solution that\ncan integrate with existing DW or BI solutions. Datameer users can also\ngain instant insights via the Datameer App Market, which offers dozens\nof pre-built analytic applications across a variety of use cases and\ndata types.\n\n![](media/hdinsight-application-partners/concurrent4.png)  \nConcurrent, Inc.’s vision is to become the \\#1 software platform choice\nfor Big Data applications. Concurrent builds application infrastructure\nproducts that are designed to help enterprises create, deploy, run and\nmanage data processing applications at scale on Apache Hadoop.\nConcurrent is the mind behind Cascading™, the most widely used and\ndeployed technology for Big Data applications with more than 75,000+\nuser downloads a month. Used by thousands of data driven businesses\nincluding Twitter, eBay, The Climate Corp and Etsy, Cascading is the\nde-facto standard in open source application infrastructure technology.\n\nhttp://www.concurrentinc.com/\n\n![](media/hdinsight-application-partners/bluetalon5.png)  \nToday’s businesses collect more and more data and need to explicitly\ndefine the scope of access that users should have to that data. Any\ndisconnect between what data users have access to and what they actually\nneed to do their job can leave companies exposed to unnecessary risks.\nAs enterprises build big data environments, they must redefine how they\ncontrol their data. BlueTalon delivers the best data control technology\nfor today’s data challenge and keeps you in control of your data.\n\nhttp://bluetalon.com/\n\n![](media/hdinsight-application-partners/redpoint6.png)  \nFor organizations eager to make Hadoop part of their data ecosystem, but\nstruggling to find people with MapReduce skills, RedPoint has a\nsolution. RedPoint’s top-rated data quality and data integration\ncapabilities are now available for Hadoop.\n\nWith RedPoint, the same data analysts and database administrators\nalready working with traditional databases can now work just as easily\nwith data stored in Hadoop. No new skills are required. No MapReduce, no\nHive, no Pig – thanks to RedPoint’s graphical user interface and pure\nYARN architecture (certified on Hadoop 2.0 by Hortonworks).\n\nWith RedPoint:  \n-  All data quality and data integration functions can be performed in the\nHadoop cluster – ELT, cleanse, match, de-dupe, merge/purge,\nhouseholding, parsing, partitioning, appending, address standardization,\nkey creation and maintenance, automation, monitoring, notification  \n-  No MapReduce is involved, and no MapReduce skills are needed  \n-  Data quality and integration processes execute as efficiently – and in\nmany cases more efficiently – with RedPoint as with MapReduce-based\nsolutions  \n-  Data doesn’t need to be moved out of Hadoop for processing, analytics,\nreporting or other action  \n-  No software needs to be installed in the cluster itself, and RedPoint\nrespects YARN’s task prioritization rather than competing for computing\nresources in the cluster  \n-  Users can manage data in both traditional and Hadoop repositories with a single product, even bringing together data from separate environments\nor migrate data from one to the other\n\nFor more information, see the resources on the right-hand side of this\npage.\n\nRedPoint has been rated \\#1 in user surveys for speed, match quality and\nease of use, and generally for customer and third party data\nmanagement. [Contact\nus](http://www.redpoint.net/Products/BigData.aspx) to see how RedPoint\ncan make managing data quality and data integration in your Hadoop\nenvironment easier, faster, lower-cost and more effective.\n\n![](media/hdinsight-application-partners/cask7.png)  \nCask is an open source big data software company focused on developers.\nThe Cask Data Application Platform (CDAP), our flagship product, makes\nit easy for any Java developer to build, debug, test, scale, and manage\nApache Hadoop applications and then deploy them instantly to a\nHortonworks Data Platform Hadoop cluster.
