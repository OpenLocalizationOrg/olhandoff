  "content": "# Writing a custom DSC resource with PowerShell classes\n\n> Applies To: Windows Windows PowerShell 5.0\n\nWith the introduction of PowerShell classes in Windows PowerShell 5.0, you can now define a DSC resource by creating a class. The class defines both the schema and the implementation of the resource, so there is no need to create a separate MOF file. The folder structure for a class-based resource is also simpler, because a **DSCResources** folder is not necessary.\n\nIn a class-based DSC resource, the schema is defined as properties of the class which can be modified with attributes to specify the property type.. The resource is implemented by **Get()**, **Set()**, and **Test()** methods (equivalent to the **Get-TargetResource**, **Set-TargetResource**, and **Test-TargetResource** functions in a script resource.\n\nIn this topic, we will create a simple resource named **FileResource** that manages a file in a specified path.\n\nFor more information about DSC resources, see [Build Custom Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](authoringResource.md)\n\n## Folder structure for a class resource\n\nTo implement a DSC custom resource with a PowerShell class, create the following folder structure. The class is defined in **MyDscResource.psm1** and the module manifest is defined in **MyDscResource.psd1**.\n\n```\n$env: psmodulepath (folder)\n    |- MyDscResources (folder)\n        |- MyDscResource.psm1 \n           MyDscResource.psd1 \n```\n\n## Create the class\n\nYou use the class keyword to create a PowerShell class. To specify that a class is a DSC resource, use the **DscResource()** attribute. The name of the class is the name of the DSC resource.\n\n```powershell\n[DscResource()]\nclass FileResource{\n}\n```\n\n### Declare properties\n\nThe DSC resource schema is defined as properties of the class. We declare three properties as follows.\n\n```powershell\n[DscProperty(Key)]\n[string]$Path\n\n\n[DscProperty(Mandatory)]\n[Ensure] $Ensure\n\n\n[DscProperty(Mandatory)]\n[string] $SourcePath\n\n[DscProperty(NotConfigurable)]\n[Nullable[datetime]] $CreationTime\n```\n\nNotice that the properties are modified by attributes. The attribues map to equivalent attributes used in MOF classes as follows.\n\nProperty attribute in class MOF attribute   Description\nDscProperty(Key)\nKey\nThe property is required. The property is a key. The values of all properties marked as keys must combine to uniquely identify a resource instance within a configuration.\nDscProperty(Mandatory)\nRequired\nThe property is required.\nDscProperty(NotConfigurable)\nread\nThe property is read-only. Properties marked with this attribute cannot be set by a configuration, but are populated by the Get() method when present.\nDscProperty()\nWrite\nThe property is configurable, but it is not required.\n\nThe **$Path** and **$SourcePath** properties are both strings. The **$CreationTime** is a [DateTime](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.aspx) property. The **$Ensure** property is an enumeration type, defined as follows.\n\n```powershell\nenum Ensure \n{ \n    Absent \n    Present \n}\n```\n\n### Implementing the methods\n\nThe **Get()**, **Set()**, and **Test()** methods are analogous to the **Get-TargetResource**, **Set-TargetResource**, and **Test-TargetResource** functions in a script resource.\n\nThis code also includes the CopyFile() function, a helper function that copies the file from **$SourcePath** to **$Path**. \n\n```powershell\n<#\n        This method is equivalent of the Set-TargetResource script function.\n        It sets the resource to the desired state.\n    #>\n    [void] Set()\n    {        \n        $fileExists = $this.TestFilePath($this.Path)\n        if($this.ensure -eq [Ensure]::Present)\n        {\n            if(-not $fileExists)\n            {\n                $this.CopyFile()\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            if($fileExists)\n            {\n                Write-Verbose -Message \"Deleting the file $($this.Path)\"\n                Remove-Item -LiteralPath $this.Path -Force\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    <# \n\n        This method is equivalent of the Test-TargetResource script function. \n        It should return True or False, showing whether the resource\n        is in a desired state.         \n    #>\n    [bool] Test()\n    {\n        $present = $this.TestFilePath($this.Path)\n\n        if($this.Ensure -eq [Ensure]::Present)\n        {\n            return $present\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            return -not $present\n        }\n    }\n    \n\n    <#\n        This method is equivalent of the Get-TargetResource script function.\n        The implementation should use the keys to find appropriate resources.\n        This method returns an instance of this class with the updated key\n         properties.\n    #>\n    [FileResource] Get()\n    {\n        $present = $this.TestFilePath($this.Path)        \n        \n        if ($present)\n        {\n            $file = Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $this.Path\n            $this.CreationTime = $file.CreationTime\n            $this.Ensure = [Ensure]::Present\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            $this.CreationTime = $null\n            $this.Ensure = [Ensure]::Absent\n        }        \n\n        return $this\n    }\n\n    <#\n        Helper method to check if the file exists and it is file\n    #>\n    [bool] TestFilePath([string] $location)\n    {      \n        $present = $true\n\n        $item = Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $location -ea Ignore\n        if ($item -eq $null)\n        {\n            $present = $false            \n        }\n        elseif( $item.PSProvider.Name -ne \"FileSystem\")\n        {\n            throw \"Path $($location) is not a file path.\"\n        }\n        elseif($item.PSIsContainer)\n        {\n            throw \"Path $($location) is a directory path.\"\n        }\n        return $present\n    }\n\n    <#\n        Helper method to copy file from source to path\n    #>\n    [void] CopyFile()\n    { \n        if(-not $this.TestFilePath($this.SourcePath))\n        {\n            throw \"SourcePath $($this.SourcePath) is not found.\"\n        }\n\n        [System.IO.FileInfo] $destFileInfo = new-object System.IO.FileInfo($this.Path)\n        if (-not $destFileInfo.Directory.Exists)\n        {\n            Write-Verbose -Message \"Creating directory $($destFileInfo.Directory.FullName)\"\n\n            #use CreateDirectory instead of New-Item to avoid code\n            #

Our manifest looks like this:\n\n```powershell\n@{\n\n# Script module or binary module file associated with this manifest.\nRootModule = 'MyDscResource.psm1'\n\nDscResourcesToExport = 'FileResource'\n\n# Version number of this module.\nModuleVersion = '1.0'\n\n# ID used to uniquely identify this module\nGUID = '81624038-5e71-40f8-8905-b1a87afe22d7'\n\n# Author of this module\nAuthor = 'Microsoft Corporation'\n\n# Company or vendor of this module\nCompanyName = 'Microsoft Corporation'\n\n# Copyright statement for this module\nCopyright = '(c) 2014 Microsoft. All rights reserved.'\n\n# Description of the functionality provided by this module\n# Description = ''\n\n# Minimum version of the Windows PowerShell engine required by this module\nPowerShellVersion = '5.0'\n\n# Name of the Windows PowerShell host required by this module\n# PowerShellHostName = ''\n} \n```\n\n## Test the resource\n\nAfter saving the class and manifest files in the folder structure as described earlier, you can create a configuration that uses the new resource. For information about how to run a DSC configuration, see [Enacting configurations](enactingConfigurations.md). The following configuration will check to see whether the file at `c:\\test\\test.txt` exists, and, if not, copies the file from `c:\\test.txt` (you should create `c:\\test.txt` before you run the configuration).\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration Test\n{\n    Import-DSCResource -module MyDscResource\n    FileResource file\n    {\n        Path = \"C:\\test\\test.txt\"\n        SourcePath = \"c:\\test.txt\"\n        Ensure = \"Present\"\n    } \n}\nTest\nStart-DscConfiguration -Wait -Force Test\n```\n\n## See Also\n### Concepts\n[Build Custom Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration Resources](authoringResource.md)"
