This allows the virtual machine to be moved back to a host running Windows 8.1. You won't have access to new virtual machine features until you manually update the virtual machine configuration version. \n\nThe virtual machine configuration version represents what version of Hyper-V the virtual machine’s configuration, saved state, and snapshot files it's compatible with. Virtual machines with configuration version 5 are compatible with Windows 8.1 and can run on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. Virtual machines with configuration version 6 are compatible with Windows 10 and won't run on Windows 8.1.\n\nIt is not necessary to upgrade all of your virtual machines simultaneously. You can choose to upgrade specific virtual machines when required. However, you won't have access to new the virtual machine features until you manually update the configuration version for each virtual machine.  \n\n\n----------------\n**Important **\n\n• After you upgrade the virtual machine configuration version, you can't move the virtual machine to a host that runs Windows 8.1.\n\n• You can't downgrade the virtual machine configuration version from version 6 to version 5.\n\n• You must turn off the virtual machine to upgrade the virtual machine configuration.\n\n• After the upgrade, the virtual machine uses the new configuration file format. For more information, see New virtual machine configuration file format.\n\n--------\n\n\n\n\n\n## What happens when I upgrade the version of a virtual machine?\nWhen you manually upgrade the configuration version of a virtual machine to version 6.x, you'll change the file structure that is used for storing the virtual machines configuration and checkpoint files. \n\nUpgraded virtual machines use a new configuration file format, which is designed to increase the efficiency of reading and writing virtual machine configuration data. The upgrade also reduces the potential for data corruption in the event of a storage failure. \n\nThe following table lists the binary file locations and extension information for an upgraded virtual machine.  \n\n|**Virtual machine configuration and checkpoint files (version 6.x)**|**Description**||\n|:---------------|:----------------||\n|**Virtual machine configuration** | Configuration information is stored in a binary file format that uses the .vmcx extension. ||\n|**Virtual machine Runtime State** | Runtime state data is stored in a binary file format that uses the .vmrs extension.  ||\n|**Virtual machine virtual hard disk**|The virtual hard disk files for the virtual machine. They use .vhd or .vhdx file extensions.   ||\n|**Automatic  virtual hard disk files**| The differencing disk files used for virtual machine checkpoints. They use the .avhdx file extensions. ||\n|**Checkpoint Files** |Checkpoints are stored in multiple checkpoint files. Each checkpoint creates a configuration file and runtime state file. Checkpoint files use the .vmrs and .vmcx file extensions. These new file formats are also used for production checkpoints and standard checkpoints. ||\n\nAfter you upgrade the virtual machine configuration version to version 6.x, it is not possible to downgrade from version 6.x to version 5. \n\nThe virtual machine must be turned off to upgrade the virtual machine configuration.\n\nThe following table lists the default file locations for new or upgraded virtual machines.\n\n|   **Virtual Machine Files (Version 6.x)** | **Description** ||\n|:-----|:-----||\n|**Virtual machine configuration file**| C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Hyper-V\\Virtual Machines ||\n|**Virtual machine runtime state file**| C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Hyper-V\\Virtual Machines ||\n|**Checkpoint Files (.vmrs, .vmcx)**| C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Snapshots ||\n|**Virtual hard disk file (.vhd/.vhdx)**| C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Hyper-V\\Virtual Hard Disks ||\n|**Automatic virtual hard disk files (.avhdx)**| C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\Hyper-V\\Virtual Hard Disks ||\n\n\n\n\n"
