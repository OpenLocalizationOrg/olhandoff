This allows API Management customers to securely connect to their backend web services that are on-premises or are otherwise inaccessible to the public internet.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Azure API Management works with classic VNETs. For information on creating a classic VNET, see [Create a virtual network (classic) by using the Azure Portal](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-classic-pportal.md).

To switch to it, open your API Management service in the [Azure Classic Portal][] and then open the **Scale** tab. Under the **General** section select the Premium tier and click Save.\n\nTo enable VPN connectivity, open your API Management service in the [Azure Classic Portal][] and switch to the **Configure** tab. \n\nUnder the VPN section, switch **VPN connection** to **On**.\n\n![Configure tab of API Management instance][api-management-setup-vpn-configure]\n\nYou will now see a list of all regions where your API Management service is provisioned.\n\nSelect a VPN and subnet for every region.

You will not be able to perform other operations on the API Management service from the Azure Classic Portal while it is updating.
