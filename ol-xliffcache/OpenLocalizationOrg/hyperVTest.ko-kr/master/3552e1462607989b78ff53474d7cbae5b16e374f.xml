The key concept in the ADF model is pipeline. A pipelines is a logical groupings of Activities, each of which defines the actions to perform on the data contained in Datasets. Linked services are used to define the information needed for Data Factory to connect to the data resources.\n\nWith ADF, existing data processing services can be composed into data pipelines that are highly available and managed in the cloud. These data pipelines can be scheduled to ingest, prepare, transform, analyze, and publish data, and ADF will manage and orchestrate all of the complex data and processing dependencies. Solutions can be quickly built and deployed in the cloud, connecting a growing number of on-premises and cloud data sources.\n\nConsider using ADF when data needs to be continually migrated in a hybrid scenario that accesses both on-premise and cloud resources, and when the data is transacted or needs to be modified or have business logic added to it in the course of being migrated. ADF allows for the scheduling and monitoring of jobs using simple JSON scripts that manage the movement of data on a periodic basis. ADF also has other capabilities such as support for complex operations. For more information on ADF, see the documentation at [Azure Data Factory (ADF)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory/).\n\n## <a name=\"scenario\"></a>The Scenario\n\nWe set up an ADF pipeline that composes two data migration activities that together move data on a daily basis between an on-premise SQL database and an Azure SQL Database in the cloud. The two activities are:\n\n* copy data from an on-premise SQL Server database to an Azure Blob Storage account\n* copy data from the Azure Blob Storage account to an Azure SQL Database.\n\n**Reference**: The steps shown here have been adapted from the more detailed tutorial [Enable your pipelines to work with on-premises data](data-factory-use-onpremises-datasources.md) provided by the ADF team and references to the relevant sections of that topic are provided when appropriate.\n\n\n## <a name=\"prereqs\"></a>Prerequisites\nThis tutorial assumes you have:\n\n* An **Azure subscription**. If you do not have a subscription, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).\n* An **Azure storage account**. You will use an Azure storage account for storing the data in this tutorial. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the [Create a storage account](storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account) article. After you have created the storage account, you will need to obtain the account key used to access the storage. See [View, copy and regenerate storage access keys](storage-create-storage-account.md#view-copy-and-regenerate-storage-access-keys).\n* Access to an **Azure SQL Database**. If you must setup an Azure SQL Database, [Getting Started with Microsoft Azure SQL Database ](sql-database-get-started.md) provides information on how to provision a new instance of a Azure SQL Database.\n* Installed and configured **Azure PowerShell** locally. For instructions, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](powershell-install-configure.md).\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] This procedure uses the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).\n\n##<a name=\"upload-data\"></a> Upload the data to your on-premise SQL Server\n\nWe use the [NYC Taxi dataset](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/) to demonstrate the migration process. The NYC Taxi dataset is available, as noted that post, on Azure blob storage [NYC Taxi Data](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/). The data has two files, the trip_data.csv file which contains trip details and the  trip_far.csv file which contains details of the fare paid for each trip. A sample and description of these files are provided in [NYC Taxi Trips Dataset Description](machine-learning-data-science-process-sql-walkthrough.md#dataset).\n\n\nYou can either adapt the procedure provided here to a set of your own data or follow the steps as described by using the NYC Taxi dataset. To upload the NYC Taxi dataset into your on-premise SQL Server database, follow the procedure outlined in [Bulk Import Data into SQL Server Database](machine-learning-data-science-process-sql-walkthrough.md#dbload). These instructions are for a SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine, but the procedure for uploading to the on-premise SQL Server is the same.\n\n##<a name=\"create-adf\"></a> Create an Azure Data Factory\n\nThe instructions for creating a new Azure Data Factory and a resource group in the [Azure Portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) are provided [Create an Azure Data Factory](data-factory-build-your-first-pipeline-using-editor.md#step-1-creating-the-data-factory). Name the new ADF instance *adfdsp* and name the resource group created *adfdsprg*.\n\n## Install and configure up the Data Management Gateway\n\nTo enable your pipelines in an Azure data factory to work with an on-premise SQL Server, you need to add it as a linked service to the data factory. To create a Linked Service for the on-premise SQL Server, you must first download and install Microsoft Data Management Gateway onto the on-premise computer and configure the linked service for the on-premises data source to use the gateway. The Data Management Gateway serializes and deserializes the source and sink data on the computer where it is hosted.\n\nFor set-up instructions and details on Data Management Gateway, see [Enable your pipelines to work with on-premises data](data-factory-use-onpremises-datasources.md)\n\n\n## <a name=\"adflinkedservices\"></a>Create linked services to connect to the data resources\n\nA linked service defines the information needed for Azure Data Factory to connect to a data resource. The step-by-step procedure for creating linked services is provided in [Create linked services](data-factory-use-onpremises-datasources.md#step-2-create-linked-services).\n\nWe have three resources in this scenario for which linked services are needed.\n\n1. [Linked service for on-premise SQL Server](#adf-linked-service-onprem-sql)\n2. [Linked service for Azure Blob Storage](#adf-linked-service-blob-store)\n3. [Linked service for Azure SQL database](#adf-linked-service-azure-sql)\n\n\n###<a name=\"adf-linked-service-onprem-sql\"></a>Linked service for on-premise SQL Server database\nTo create the linked service for the on-premise SQL Server, click on the **Data Store** in the ADF landing page on Azure Classic Portal, select *SQL* and enter the credentials for the *username* and *password* for the on-premise SQL Server. You need to enter the servername as a **fully qualified servername backslash instance name (servername\\instancename)**. Name the linked service *adfonpremsql*.\n\n###<a name=\"adf-linked-service-blob-store\"></a>Linked service for Blob\nTo create the linked service for the Azure Blob Storage account, click on the **Data Store** in the ADF landing page on Azure Classic Portal, select *Azure Storage Account* and enter the Azure Blob Storage account key and container name. Name the link service *adfds*.\n\n###<a name=\"adf-linked-service-azure-sql\"></a>Linked service for Azure SQL database\nTo create the linked service for the Azure SQL Database, click on the **Data Store** in the ADF landing page on Azure Classic Portal, select *Azure SQL* and enter the credentials for the *username* and *password* for the Azure SQL Database. The *username* must be specified as *user@servername*.   \n\n\n##<a name=\"adf-tables\"></a>Define and create tables to specify how to access the datasets\n\nCreate tables that specify the structure, location and availability of the datasets with the following script-based procedures. JSON files are used to define the tables. For more information on the structure of these files, see [Datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md).\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]  You should execute the `Add-AzureAccount` cmdlet prior to executing the [New-AzureDataFactoryTable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835096.aspx) cmdlet to confirm that the right Azure subscription is selected for the command execution. For documentation of this cmdlet, see [Add-AzureAccount](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790372.aspx).\n\nThe JSON-based definitions in the tables use the following names:\n\n* the **table name** in the on-premise SQL server is *nyctaxi_data*\n* the **container name** in the Azure Blob Storage account is *containername*  \n\nThree table definitions are needed for this ADF pipeline:\n\n1. [SQL on-premise Table](#adf-table-onprem-sql)\n2. [Blob Table ](#adf-table-blob-store)\n3. [SQL Azure Table](#adf-table-azure-sql)\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]  The following procedures use Azure PowerShell to define and create the ADF activities.
