data from another DPM server in the backup vault\nYou can now recover the data you've protected to an Azure Backup vault from any DPM server registered to that vault. The process for doing so is completely integrated into the DPM management console and is similar to the other recovery workflows.\n\nTo recover data from another DPM server inthe backup vault you'll need [System Center Data Protection Manager UR7](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3065246) and the [latest Azure Backup agent](http://aka.ms/azurebackup_agent).\n\n## Recover data from another DPM Server\nTo recover data from another DPM server:\n\n1.

The agent is unable to decrypt the data. Hence the recovery fails.<br>**Resolution:** Please provide the exact same encryption passphrase associated with the DPM server whose data is being recovered.|\n\n## Frequently asked questions:\n1. **Why can’t I add an external DPM server from another DPM server after installing the UR7 and latest Azure Backup agent?**\n\n    A) For the existing DPM servers with data sources that are protected to the cloud (by using an update rollup earlier than Update Rollup 7), you have to wait at least one day after installing the UR7 and latest Azure Backup agent to start *Add External DPM server*. This is needed to upload the metadata of the DPM protection groups to Azure. This occurs the first time through a nightly job.\n\n2. **What is the minimum version of Azure Backup agent needed?**\n\n    A) The Azure Backup agent minimum version to enable this feature is 2.0.8719.0.  Azure Backup agent version can be verified by navigating to Control Panel **>** All Control Panel items **>** Programs and features **>** Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent. If the version is less than 2.0.8719.0, download the [latest Azure Backup agent](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=288905) and install.\n\n    ![Clear External DPM](./media/backup-azure-alternate-dpm-server/external-dpm-azurebackupagentversion.png)\n\n## Next Steps:\n•   [Azure Backup FAQ](backup-azure-backup-faq.md)\n"}
