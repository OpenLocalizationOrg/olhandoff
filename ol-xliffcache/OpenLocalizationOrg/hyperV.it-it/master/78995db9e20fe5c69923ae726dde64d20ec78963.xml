It is the vault used by the Azure Backup and the Azure Site Recovery(ASR) services. Think of it as the v.2 vault.\n\n## Recovery Services and Backup vaults\n\n**Q1. Recovery Services vaults are v.2, are Backup vaults (v.1) still supported?** <br/>\nA1. Yes, Backup vaults are still supported. Create Backup vaults in the Classic portal. Create Recovery Services vaults in the Azure portal.\n\n**Q2. Can I migrate a Backup vault to a Recovery Services vault?** <br/>\nA2. Unfortunately no, at this time you can't migrate the contents of a Backup vault to a Recovery Services vault. We are working on adding this functionality, but it is not available as part of Public Preview.\n\n**Q3. Do Recovery Services vaults support v.1 or v.2 VMs?** <br/>\n A3. Recovery Services vaults support v.1 and v.2 VMs. You can back up a VM created in the Classic portal (which is V.1), or a VM created in the Azure portal (which is V.2) to a Recovery Services vault.\n\n\n## ARM support for Azure VMs\n\n**Q1. Are there any limitations with ARM support for Azure VMs?** <br/>\nA1. The PowerShell cmdlets for ARM are currently not available. You must use the Azure portal UI to add resources to a resource group.\n"}
