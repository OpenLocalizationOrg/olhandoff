Part3. Checkpoints are a helpful tool when you want to save the present state of a virtual machine before making a change such as applying an update, installing software, or changing a setting.  If the change causes issues, you can restore the checkpoint and go back.  \n\nThere are two types of checkpoints:  \n**Production checkpoints**: Used mainly on servers in production environments.  \n**Standard checkpoints**: Used in development or testing environments \n\nProduction checkpoints are the default for Hyper-V on Windows 10.\n\n\n## Change the checkpoint type\nWe'll start by trying out the older style of checkpoints, **standard checkpoints**. Since production checkpoints are the default, we need to go into the settings for the VM and change the checkpoint type.\n\n1. Right-click on **Windows Walkthrough VM** and select **Settings**.\n2. In the **Management** section, select **Checkpoints**.\n3. Select **Standard checkpoints**. The dialog should look like this:\n\n  ![](media/standard1.png)\n4.  Click **OK** to close the dialog box.\n\n## Open Notepad to test checkpoints \nIn order to see what happens with each type of checkpoint, we'll run an application in the VM. \n1. Right-click on **Windows Walkthrough VM** and select **Connect**.\n2. In the virtual machine, open **Notepad** by clicking on the **Start** menu and typing **Notepad** and then select it from the results. \n3. In Notepad, type **This is a test of checkpoints.** The file should look like this:\n  \n  ![](media/standard_notepad.png)\n4. Save the file as **test.txt**, but don't close Notepad. Leave it running in the virtual machine.\n\n## Create a standard checkpoint \n1. To create the checkpoint, click on the ![](media/checkpoint_button.png) **Checkpoint** button in the menu bar. \n2. In the checkpoint name dialog, type **Standard**. The dialog should look like this:\n\n  ![](media/save_standard.png) \n3. When the process is complete, the checkpoint will appear under **Checkpoints** in the **Hyper-V Manager**.\n\n  ![](media/standard_complete.png) \n\n## Create a production checkpoint \nNow, we need to change change the type of checkpoint that we want to take back to **Production checkpoints** before taking a second checkpoint.\n\n1.  Right-click the virtual machine, and click **Settings**.\n2.  In the **Management** section, select **Checkpoints**.\n3.  Select **Production checkpoints**.\n4.  Clear the fall-back option. If the system can't take a production checkpoint, we want it to fail instead of taking a standard checkpoint.\n\n  ![](media/production.png)\n5.  click **OK** to close the dialog box.\n6.  Right-click on the VM again and select **Connect**.\n7.  In Notepad in the VM, type another line that reads **This is a test of a production checkpoint** and save the file again.\n8.  Click on the ![](media/checkpoint_button.png) **Checkpoint** button in the menu bar.\n9.  When asked, name it **Production** and then click **Yes**.\n\n  ![](media/production_CheckpointName.png) \n10. Close VMConnect. The VM will continue running, you just won't be connected to it anymore.\n11. In Hyper-V manager, your list of checkpoints will now look like this:\n\n  ![](media/production_complete.png)\n\n\n\n## Apply the standard checkpoint \n\n1.  In **Hyper-V Manager**, in the **Checkpoints** section, right-click the one titled **Standard** and click **Apply**.\n2.  In the pop-up dialog, click **Create Checkpoint and Apply**. \n\n  ![](media/apply_standard.png)\n34. When the finished, your list of checkpoints will now look something like this:\n\n  ![](media/standard_applied.png)\n4. When this finishes, right-click the VM and the click **Connect** to connect to the VM. \n5. When you connect to the VM, the VM should be running, with Notepad open, but the line about production checkpoints will be missing:\n\n  ![](media/standard_applied_notepad.png)\n6. Close VMConnect, but leave the VM running.\n\n\n## Apply the production checkpoint \nNow, let's go back to Hyper-V manager and apply the production checkpoint and see how our VM looks afterwards.\n\n1.  In the Checkpoints section, right-click the one titled **Production Checkpoint** and click **Apply**.\n2.  In the pop-up dialog, pick **Create Checkpoint and Apply**. \n3. When this finishes, right-click the VM and the click **Connect** to launch the VM. \n4. You'll notice that the VM is not running. Click on the ![](media/start.png) Start button in the menu bar to start the VM.\n5. Open open test.txt in Notepad. You should see the line in the file about testing production checkpoints:\n\n  ![](media/production_notepad.png)\n    \n\n## Rename a checkpoint ##\n1. Right-click the last checkpoint in the tree and click Rename.\n2. Name the checkpoint **Delete me**.\n\n  ![](media/delete_me.png)\n\n## Delete a checkpoint \nThe previous step has probably given you a hint about what we'll do next. We are going to delete the checkpoint that you just renamed.\n\n1. Right-click on the checkpoint named **Delete me** and click **Delete checkpoint**. \n\n  ![](media/delete_checkpoint.png)\n2. In the warning dialog, click **Delete**. \n\n  ![](media/delete_warn.png)\n3.
