Create and publish a Machine Learning Request-Response service (RRS)\n2. Deploy the service to production, and obtain the API Key and OData endpoint information.\n3. Use the URL of the published web service to publish to [Azure Marketplace (Data Market)](https://publish.windowsazure.com/workspace/) \n4. Once submitted, your offer is reviewed and needs to be approved before your customers can start purchasing it. The publishing process can take a few business days. \n\n## Walk through\n###Step 1: Create and publish a Machine Learning Request-Response service (RRS)###\n If you have not done this already, please take a look at this [walk through](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md).\n\n###Step 2: Deploy the service to production, and obtain the API Key and OData endpoint information###\n1. From the [Azure Classic Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), select the **MACHINE LEARNING** option from the left navigation bar, and select your workspace. \n\n2. Click on the **WEB SERVICES** tab, and select the web service you would like to publish to the marketplace.\n\n    ![Azure Marketplace][workspace]\n\n3. Select the endpoint you would like to have the marketplace consume. If you have not created any additional endpoints, you can select the **Default** endpoint.\n\n4. Once you have clicked on the endpoint, you will be able to see the **API KEY**. You will need this piece of information later on in Step 3, so make a copy of it.\n\n    ![Azure Marketplace][apikey]\n\n5. Click on the **REQUEST/RESPONSE** method, at this point we do not support publishing batch execution services to the marketplace. That will take you to the API help page for the Request/Response method.\n\n6. Copy the **OData Endpoint Address**, you will need this information later on in Step 3.\n\n    ![Azure Marketplace][odata]\n\n\n\n\ndeploy the service into production.\n\n\n\n###Step 3: Use the URL of the published web service to publish to Azure Marketplace (DataMarket)###\n\n1.  Navigate to [Azure Marketplace (Data Market)](http://datamarket.azure.com/home) \n2.  Click on the **Publish** link at the top of the page. This will take you to the [Microsoft Azure Publishing Portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com)\n3.  Click on the **publishers** section to register as a publisher.\n4.  When creating a new offer, select **Data Services**, then click **Create a New Data Service**. \n \n    ![Azure Marketplace][image1]\n\n    <br />\n\n\n5.  Under **Plans** provide information on your offering, including a pricing plan. Decide if you will offer a free or paid service. To get paid, provide payment information such as your bank and tax information.\n\n6.  Under **Marketing** provide information about your offer, such as the title and description for your offer.\n\n7.  Under **Pricing** you can set the price for your plans for specific countries, or let the system \"autoprice\" your offer.\n\n8. On the **Data Service** tab, click **Web Service** as the **Data Source**.\n\n    ![Azure Marketplace][image2]\n\n9.  Get the web service URL and API key from the Azure Classic Portal, as explained in step 2 above.\n\n10. In the Marketplace Data Service setup dialog box, paste the OData endpoint address into the **Service URL** text box.\n\n11. For **Authentication**, choose **Header** as the **Authentication Scheme**.\n\n    - Enter \"Authorization\" for the **Header Name**.\n    - For the **Header Value**, enter \"Bearer\" (without the quotation marks), click the **Space** bar, and then paste the API key.\n    - Select the **This Service is OData** check box.\n    - Click **Test Connection** to test the connection.\n\n12. Under **Categories**, ensure **Machine Learning** is selected.\n\n13. When you are done entering all the metadata about your offer, click on **Publish**, and then **Push to Staging**. At this point, you will be notified of any remaining issues that you need to fix.\n\n14. After you have ensured completion of all the outstanding issues, click on **Request approval to push to Production**. The publishing process can take a few business days. \n\n\n[image1]:./media/machine-learning-publish-web-service-to-azure-marketplace/image1.png\n[image2]:./media/machine-learning-publish-web-service-to-azure-marketplace/image2.png\n[workspace]:./media/machine-learning-publish-web-service-to-azure-marketplace/selectworkspace.png\n[apikey]:./media/machine-learning-publish-web-service-to-azure-marketplace/apikey.png\n[odata]:./media/machine-learning-publish-web-service-to-azure-marketplace/odata.png\n \n"
