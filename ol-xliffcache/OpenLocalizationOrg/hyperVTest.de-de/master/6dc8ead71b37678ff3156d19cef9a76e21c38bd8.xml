Then, we can use it as an example of how you can use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning with Machine Learning Studio and the Machine Learning web service to create such a predictive analytics solution.  \n\nIn this detailed walkthrough, we'll follow the process of developing a predictive analytics model in Machine Learning Studio and then deploying it as an Azure Machine Learning web service.
