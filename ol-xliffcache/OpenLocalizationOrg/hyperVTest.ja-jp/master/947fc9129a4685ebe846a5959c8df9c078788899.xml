While traditional MapReduce batch processing can be used for this analysis, you must be able to quickly and efficiently load the data from all vehicles into Hadoop before MapReduce processing can occur.

From there, a Storm Topology running on an Apache Storm on HDInsight cluster reads the data, processes it, and stores it into HDFS.\n\nDuring processing, the VIN is used to retrieve model information from Azure DocumentDB. This is added to the data stream before it is stored.\n\nThe components used in the Storm Topology are:\n\n* **EventHubSpout** - reads data from Azure Event Hubs\n\n* **TypeConversionBolt** - converts the JSON string from Event Hubs into a tuple containing the individual data values for engine temperature, ambient temperature, speed, VIN, and timestamp\n\n* **DataReferencBolt** - looks up the vehicle model from DocumentDB using the VIN\n\n* **WasbStoreBolt** - stores the data to HDFS (Azure Storage)\n\nThe following is a diagram of this solution:\n\n![storm topology](./media/hdinsight-storm-iot-eventhub-documentdb/iottopology.png)\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] This is a simplified diagram, and each component in the solution may have multiple instances.
