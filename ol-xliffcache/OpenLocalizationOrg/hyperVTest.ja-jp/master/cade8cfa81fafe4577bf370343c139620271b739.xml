Use it to:\n    * Define or import API schema.\n    * Package APIs into products.\n    * Set up policies like quotas or transformations on the APIs.\n    * Get insights from analytics.\n    * Manage users.\n\n* The **developer portal** serves as the main web presence for developers, where they can:\n    * Read API documentation.\n    * Try out an API via the interactive console.\n    * Create an account and subscribe to get API keys.\n    * Access analytics on their own usage.\n\n\n## <a name=\"create-service-instance\"> </a>Create an API Management instance\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial][].\n\nThe first step in working with API Management is to create a service instance. Sign in to the [Azure Classic Portal][] and click **New**, **App Services**, **API Management**, **Create**.\n\n![API Management new instance][api-management-create-instance-menu]\n\nFor **URL**, specify a unique sub-domain name to use for the service URL.\n\nChoose the desired **Subscription** and **Region** for your service instance. After making your selections, click the **Next** button.\n\n![New API Management service][api-management-create-instance-step1]\n\nEnter **Contoso Ltd.** for the **Organization Name**, and enter your email address in the **Administrator E-Mail** field.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] This email address is used for notifications from the API Management system. For more information, see [How to configure notifications and email templates in Azure API Management][].\n\n![New API Management service][api-management-create-instance-step2]\n\nAPI Management service instances are available in three tiers: Developer, Standard, and Premium. By default, new API Management service instances are created in the Developer tier. To select the Standard or Premium tier, check the **Advanced settings** check box and select the desired tier on the following screen.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] The Developer Tier is for development, testing, and pilot API programs where high availability is not a concern. In the Standard and Premium tiers, you can scale your reserved unit count to handle more traffic. The Standard and Premium tiers provide your API Management service with the most processing power and performance. You can complete this tutorial by using any tier. For more information about API Management tiers, see [API Management pricing][].\n\nClick the check box to create your service instance.\n\n![New API Management service][api-management-instance-created]\n\nOnce the service instance is created, the next step is to create or import an API.\n\n## <a name=\"create-api\"> </a>Import an API\n\nAn API consists of a set of operations that can be invoked from a client application. API operations are proxied to existing web services.\n\nAPIs can be created (and operations can be added) manually, or they can be imported. In this tutorial, we will import the API for a sample calculator web service provided by Microsoft and hosted on Azure.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] For guidance on creating an API and manually adding operations, see [How to create APIs](api-management-howto-create-apis.md) and [How to add operations to an API](api-management-howto-add-operations.md).\n\nAPIs are configured from the publisher portal, which is accessed through the Azure Classic Portal. To reach the publisher portal, click **Manage** in the Azure Classic Portal for your API Management service.\n\n![Publisher portal][api-management-management-console]\n\nTo import the calculator API, click **APIs** from the **API Management** menu on the left, and then click **Import API**.\n\n![Import API button][api-management-import-api]\n\nPerform the following steps to configure the calculator API:\n\n1. Click **From URL**, enter **http://calcapi.cloudapp.net/calcapi.json** into the **Specification document URL** text box, and click the **Swagger** radio button.\n2. Type **calc** into the **Web API URL suffix** text box.\n3. Click in the **Products (optional)** box and choose **Starter**.\n4. Click **Save** to import the API.\n\n![Add new API][api-management-import-new-api]\n\nOnce the API is imported, the summary page for the API is displayed in the publisher portal.\n\n![API summary][api-management-imported-api-summary]\n\nThe API section has several tabs. The **Summary** tab displays basic metrics and information about the API. The [Settings](api-management-howto-create-apis.md#configure-api-settings) tab is used to view and edit the configuration for an API. The [Operations](api-management-howto-add-operations.md) tab is used to manage the API's operations. The **Security** tab can be used to configure gateway authentication for the backend server by using Basic authentication or [mutual certificate authentication](api-management-howto-mutual-certificates.md), and to configure [user authorization by using OAuth 2.0](api-management-howto-oauth2.md).  The **Issues** tab is used to view issues reported by the developers who are using your APIs. The **Products** tab is used to configure the products that contain this API.\n\nBy default, each API Management instance comes with two sample products:\n\n-   **Starter**\n-   **Unlimited**\n\nIn this tutorial, the Basic Calculator API was added to the Starter product when the API was imported.\n\nIn order to make calls to an API, developers must first subscribe to a product that gives them access to it. Developers can subscribe to products in the developer portal, or administrators can subscribe developers to products in the publisher portal. You are an administrator since you created the API Management instance in the previous steps in the tutorial, so you are already subscribed to every product by default.\n\n## <a name=\"call-operation\"> </a>Call an operation from the developer portal\n\nOperations can be called directly from the developer portal, which provides a convenient way to view and test the operations of an API. In this tutorial step, you will call the Basic Calculator API's **Add two integers** operation. Click **Developer portal** from the menu at the top right of the publisher portal.\n\n![Developer portal][api-management-developer-portal-menu]\n\nClick **APIs** from the top menu, and then click **Basic Calculator** to see the available operations.\n\n![Developer portal][api-management-developer-portal-calc-api]\n\nNote the sample descriptions and parameters that were imported along with the API and operations, providing documentation for the developers that will use this operation. These descriptions can also be added when operations are added manually.\n\nTo call the **Add two integers** operation, click **Try it**.\n\n![Try it][api-management-developer-portal-calc-api-console]\n\nYou can enter some values for the parameters or keep the defaults, and then click **Send**.\n\n![HTTP Get][api-management-invoke-get]\n\nAfter an operation is invoked, the developer portal displays the **Response status**, the **Response headers**, and any **Response content**.\n\n![Response][api-management-invoke-get-response]\n\n## <a name=\"view-analytics\"> </a>View analytics\n\nTo view analytics for Basic Calculator, switch back to the publisher portal by selecting **Manage** from the menu at the top right of the developer portal.\n\n![Manage][api-management-manage-menu]\n\nThe default view for the publisher portal is the **Dashboard**, which provides an overview of your API Management instance.\n\n![Dashboard][api-management-dashboard]\n\nHover the mouse over the chart for **Basic Calculator** to see the specific metrics for the usage of the API for a given time period.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] If you don't see any lines on your chart, switch back to the developer portal and make some calls into the API, wait a few moments, and then come back to the dashboard.\n\nClick **View Details** to view the summary page for the API, including a larger version of the displayed metrics.\n\n![Analytics][api-management-mouse-over]\n\n![Summary][api-management-api-summary-metrics]\n\nFor detailed metrics and reports, click **Analytics** from the **API Management** menu on the left.\n\n![Overview][api-management-analytics-overview]\n\nThe **Analytics** section has the following four tabs:\n\n-   **At a glance** provides overall usage and health metrics, as well as the top developers, top products, top APIs, and top operations.\n-   **Usage** provides an in-depth look at API calls and bandwidth, including a geographical representation.\n-   **Health** focuses on status codes, cache success rates, response times, and API and service response times.\n-   **Activity** provides reports that drill down on the specific activity by developer, product, API, and operation.\n\n## <a name=\"next-steps\"> </a>Next steps\n\n-   Check out the other topics in the [Get started with advanced API configuration][] tutorial.\n\n[Azure Free Trial]:
