As the IT administrator of Contoso, we want to share applications with employees from three partner companies. None of the partner companies need to have Azure AD.\n\n- Alice from Simple Partner Org\n- Bob, from Medium Partner Org, needs access to a set of apps\n- Carol, from Complex Partner Org, needs access to a set of apps, and membership in groups at Contoso\n\nAfter invitations are sent out to partner users, we can configure them in Azure AD to grant access to apps and membership to groups through the Azure portal. Let's start by adding Alice.\n\n## Adding Alice to Contoso's directory\n1. Create a .csv file with the headers as shown, populating only Alice's **Email**, **DisplayName**, and **InviteContactUsUrl**. **DisplayName** is the name that will appear in the invite, and also the name that will appear in Contoso's Azure AD directory. **InviteContactUsUrl** is a way for Alice to contact Contoso. In the example below, is specifies Contoso's LinkedIn profile. It is important to have the labels in the first row of the .csv file in the same order and spelled the same way as shown. See the CSV Format section below.  \n![Example CSV file for Alice](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/AliceCSV.png)\n\n2. In the Azure portal, add a user into the Contoso directory (Active Directory > Contoso > Users > Add User). In the \"Type of User\" drop down, select \"Users in partner companies\". Upload the .csv file. Make sure that the .csv file is closed prior to uploading.  \n![CSV file upload for Alice](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/AliceUpload.png)\n\n3. Alice is now represented as an External User in Contoso's Azure AD directory.  \n![Alice is listed in Azure AD](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/AliceInAD.png)\n\n4. From Alice's point of view, she will receive the following email.  \n![Invitation email for Alice](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/AliceEmail.png)\n\n5. Alice clicks the link, and se is prompted to accept the invitation and to sign in using her work credentials. If Alice is not in the Azure AD directory, Alice will be prompted to sign up.  \n![Sign up after invitation for Alice](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/AliceSignUp.png)\n\n6. Alice is redirected to the App Access Panel, empty until she is granted access to apps.  \n![Access Panel for Alice](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/AliceAccessPanel.png)\n\nThis is the simplest form of B2B collaboration. As a user in Contoso's Azure AD directory, Alice can be granted access to applications and groups through the Azure portal. Now let's add Bob, who needs access to the applications Moodle and Salesforce.\n\n## Adding Bob to Contoso's directory and granting access to apps\n1. Use Windows PowerShell with the Azure AD Module installed to find the application IDs of Moodle and Salesforce. The IDs can be retrieved using the cmdlet: `Get-MsolServicePrincipal | fl DisplayName, AppPrincipalId` This brings up a list of all available applications in Contoso and their AppPrincialIds.  \n![Retrieve IDs for Bob](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/BobPowerShell.png)\n\n2. Create .csv file, populating Bob's Email, DisplayName, **InviteAppID**, **InviteAppResources**, and InviteContactUsUrl. **InviteAppResources** is populated with the AppPrincipalIds of Moodle and Salesforce found from PowerShell, separated by a space. This is highlighted by the green and blue boxed IDs which correspond to the PowerShell screenshot above. **InviteAppId** is populated by the same AppPrincipalId of Moodle to brand the email and sign in pages.  \n![Example CSV file for Bob](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/BobCSV.png)\n\n3. Upload the .csv file through the Azure Portal just as it was done for Alice. Bob is now an external user in Contoso's Azure AD directory.\n\n4. Bob will receive the following email.  \n![Invitation email for Bob](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/BobEmail.png)\n\n5. Bob clicks the link and is prompted to accept the invitation. After he is signed in, he is directed to the Access Panel and can already use Moodle and Salesforce.  \n![Access Panel for Bob](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/BobAccessPanel.png)\n\nWe will add Carol next, who needs access to applications as well as membership to groups in Contoso's directory.\n\n## Adding Carol to Contoso's directory, granting access to apps, and giving group membership\n\n1. Use Windows PowerShell with the Azure AD Module installed to find the application IDs and group IDs within Contoso.\n - Retrieve AppPrincipalId using cmdlet `Get-MsolServicePrincipal | fl DisplayName, AppPrincipalId`, same as for Bob\n - Retrieve ObjectId for groups using cmdlet `Get-MsolGroup | fl DisplayName, ObjectId` This brings up a list of all groups in Contoso and their ObjectIds. Group IDs can also be retrieved as the Object ID in the Properties tab of the group in the Azure portal.  \n![Retrieve IDs and groups for Carol](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/CarolPowerShell.png)\n\n2. Create .csv file, populating Carol's Email, DisplayName, InviteAppID, InviteAppResources, **InviteGroupResources**, and InviteContactUsUrl. **InviteGroupResources** is populated by the ObjectIds of the groups MyGroup1 and Externals, separated by a space.  \n![Example CSV file for Carol](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/CarolCSV.png)\n\n3. Upload the .csv file through the Azure portal.\n\n4. Carol is a user in Contoso's directory and is also a member of the groups MyGroup1 and Externals, as seen in the Azure portal.  \n![Carol is listed in a group in Azure AD](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/CarolGroup.png)\n\n5. Carol will receive an email containing a link to accept the invitation. After she signs in, she will be redirected to the App Access Panel to have access to Moodle and Salesforce.  \n\nThat's all there is to adding users from partner businesses in Azure AD B2B collaboration. This walkthrough demonstrated adding Alice, Bob, and Carol in three separate .csv files, but they can in fact be added together in a single .csv file for simplicity.  \n![Example CSV file for Alice, Bob, and Carol](./media/active-directory-b2b-detailed-walkthrough/CombinedCSV.png)\n\n## Related articles\nBrowse our other articles on Azure AD B2B collaboration:\n\n- [What is Azure AD B2B collaboration?](active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b.md)\n- [How it works](active-directory-b2b-how-it-works.md)\n- [CSV file format reference](active-directory-b2b-references-csv-file-format.md)\n- [External user token format](active-directory-b2b-references-external-user-token-format.md)\n- [External user object attribute changes](active-directory-b2b-references-external-user-object-attribute-changes.md)\n- [Current preview limitations](active-directory-b2b-current-preview-limitations.md)\n\n\n"
