For workloads that require local guarantees, low latencies, and higher performance, select a **Locally pinned** volume. For all other data, select a **Tiered** volume.

If you are using the tiered volume for archival data, selecting **Use this volume for less frequently accessed archival data** changes the deduplication chunk size for your volume to 512 KB. If this field is not checked, the corresponding tiered volume will use a chunk size of 64 KB. A larger deduplication chunk size allows the device to expedite the transfer of large archival data to the cloud.\n\n    3. Specify the **Provisioned Capacity** for your volume. Make a note of the capacity that is available based on the volume type selected. The specified volume size must not exceed the available space.\n\n        You can provision locally pinned volumes up to 8 TB or tiered volumes up to 200 TB on the 8100 device.

As local space on the device is required to host the working set of tiered volumes, creation of locally pinned volumes will impact the space available for provisioning tiered volumes. Therefore, if you create a locally pinned volume, space available for creation of tiered volumes will be reduced. Similarly, if a tiered volume is created, the available space for creation of  locally pinned volumes will be reduced. \n\n        If you provision a locally pinned volume of 8 TB (maximum allowable size) on your 8100 device, then you will have exhausted all the local space available on the device.
