Because new extensions are added all the time, the number of possible features your VMs support in Azure continues to increase. By default, several basic VM extensions are installed when you create your VM from the Image Gallery, including **IaaSDiagnostics** (currently Windows VMs only), **VMAccess**, and **BGInfo** (also currently Windows only). However, not all extensions are implemented on both Windows and Linux at any specific time, due to the constant flow of feature updates and new extensions.\n\n##Connectivity and Basic Management\n\nThe following extensions are critical to enabling, re-enabling, or disabling basic connectivity with your VMs once they are created and running.\n\n|VM Extension Name|Feature Description|More Information\n|---|---|---|\n|VMAccessAgent (Windows)|Create, update, and reset user information and RDP connection configurations.|[Windows](../articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-classic-extensions-customscript.md)\n|VMAccessForLinux (Linux)|Create, update, and reset user information and SSH connection configurations.|[Linux](https://github.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions/tree/master/VMAccess)\n\n##Deployment and Configuration Management\n\nThe following extensions support different kinds of deployment and configuration management scenarios and features.
