  "content": "## Prepare to authenticate Resource Manager requests\n\nYou must authenticate all the operations that you perform on resources using the [Azure Resource Manager][lnk-authenticate-arm] with Azure Active Directory (AD). The easiest way to configure this is to use PowerShell or Azure CLI.\n\nIf you have not installed [Azure PowerShell 1.0][lnk-powershell-install], you can do so with the following PowerShell commands. You will need to run PowerShell as an administrator.\n\n```\n# Install the Azure Resource Manager modules from PowerShell Gallery\nInstall-Module AzureRM\nInstall-AzureRM\n\n# Install the Azure Service Management module from PowerShell Gallery\nInstall-Module Azure\n```\n\nThe following steps show how to set up password authentication for an AD application using PowerShell. You can run these commands in a standard PowerShell session.\n\n1. Log in to your Azure subscription using the following command:\n\n    ```\n    Login-AzureRmAccount\n    ```\n\n2. Make a note of your **TenantId** and **SubscriptionId**. You will need them later.\n\n3. Create a new Azure Active Directory application using the following command, replacing the place holders:\n\n    - **{Display name}:** a display name for your application such as **MySampleApp**\n    - **{Home page URL}:** the URL of the home page of your app such as **http://mysampleapp/home**. This URL does not need to point to a real application.\n    - **{Application identifier}:** A unique identifier such as **http://mysampleapp**. This URL does not need to point to a real application.\n    - **{Password}:** A password that you will use to authenticate with your app.\n\n    ```\n    New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName {Display name} -HomePage {Home page URL} IdentifierUris {Application identifier} -Password {Password}\n    ```\n    \n4. Make a note of the **ApplicationId** of the application you created. You will need this later.\n\n5. Create a new service principal using the following command, replacing **{MyApplicationId}** with the **ApplicationId** from the previous step:\n\n    ```\n    New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId {MyApplicationId}\n    ```\n    \n6. Setup a role assignment using the following command, replacing **{MyApplicationId}** with your **ApplicationId**.\n\n    ```\n    New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Owner -ServicePrincipalName {MyApplicationId}\n    ```\n    \nYou have now finished creating the Azure AD application that will enable you to authenticate from your custom C# application. You will need the following values later in this tutorial:\n\n- TenantId\n- SubscriptionId\n- ApplicationId\n- Password\n\n[lnk-authenticate-arm]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790557.aspx\n[lnk-powershell-install]: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azps-1-0-pre/\n\n\n"
