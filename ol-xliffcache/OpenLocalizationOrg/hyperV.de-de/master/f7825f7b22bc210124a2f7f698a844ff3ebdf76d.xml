The authentication provider shown in the tutorial is Azure Active Directory, and both client and API are ASP.NET Web APIs running in API apps.\n\n## Authentication and authorization in App Service\n\nFor an introduction to authentication features used in this tutorial, see the previous tutorial in this series, [authentication and authorization for API Apps in Azure App Service](app-service-api-authentication.md).\n\n## How to follow this tutorial\n\nThis tutorial builds on a sample application that you download and create an API app for in the [first tutorial of the API Apps and ASP.NET getting started series](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md).\n\n## The CompanyUsers.API sample project\n\nIn the [ContactsList sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-api-dotnet-contact-list), the CompanyUsers.API project is a simple Web API project that contains one Get method that returns a hard-coded list of contacts. To demonstrate a service-to-service scenario, the Get method in  ContactsList.API calls the Get method in CompanyContacts.API and adds the contacts it gets back to whatever it has it in its own data store, then returns the combined list.\n\nHere is the Get method in CompanyUsers.API.\n\n        public async Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> Get()\n        {\n            var contacts = new Contact[]{\n                        new Contact { Id = 1, EmailAddress = \"nancy@contoso.com\", Name = \"Nancy Davolio\"},\n                        new Contact { Id = 2, EmailAddress = \"alexander@contoso.com\", Name = \"Alexander Carson\"}\n                    };\n        \n            return contacts;\n        }\n\n\nAnd here is the Get method in ContactsList.API, showing how it calls CompanyContacts.API and adds the results to what it returns. (Some code is omitted for clarity here.)\n\n        private async Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> GetContacts()\n        {\n            var contacts = await _storage.Get(FILENAME);\n        \n            var contactsList = contacts.ToList<Contact>();\n            using (var client = CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth())\n            {\n                var results = await client.Contacts.GetAsync();\n                foreach (Contact c in results)\n                {\n                    contactsList.Add(c);\n                }\n            }\n        \n            return contactsList;\n        }\n\nThe client object returned by `CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth()` in the code above is based on the generated client code but adds an authorization token to HTTP requests.\n\n        private static CompanyContactsAPI CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth()\n        {\n            var client = new CompanyContactsAPI(new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"CompanyContactsAPIUrl\"]));\n            client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =\n                new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", ServicePrincipal.GetS2SAccessTokenForProdMSA().AccessToken);\n            return client;\n        }\n\n## Create an API app in Azure and deploy the CompanyContacts.API project to it\n\n1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the CompanyContacts.API project, and then click **Publish**.\n\n3.  In the **Profile** step of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Microsoft Azure App Service**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/selectappservice.png)\n\n4. Sign in to your Azure account if you have not already done so, or refresh your credentials if they're expired.\n\n4. In the **App Service** dialog box, choose the Azure **Subscription** you want to use, and then click **New**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/clicknew.png)\n\n3. In the **Hosting** tab of the **Create App Service** dialog box, click **Change Type**, and then click **API App**.\n\n4. Enter an **API App Name** that is unique in the *azurewebsites.net* domain. \n\n6. In the **Resource Group** drop-down, select the resource group that you have been using for these tutorials.\n\n4. In the **App Service Plan** drop-down, select the plan that you have been using for these tutorials. \n\n7. Click **Create**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/createappservice.png)\n\n    Visual Studio creates the API app and creates a publish profile that has all of the required settings for the new API app. \n\n8. In the **Connection** tab of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/conntab.png)\n\n    Visual Studio deploys the project to the new API app and opens a browser to the URL of the API app. A \"successfully created\" page appears in the browser.\n\n9. Close the browser.\n\n## Update the generated client code in the ContactsList.API project\n\nThe ContactsList.API project already has the generated client code, but you'll delete it and regenerate it from your own API app.\n\n1. In Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, in the ContactsList.API project, delete the *CompanyContactsAPI* folder.\n\n2. Right-click the ContactsList.API project, and then click **Add > REST API Client**.\n\n3. In the **Add REST API Client** dialog box, click **Download from Microsoft Azure API App**, and then click **Browse**.\n\n8. In the **App Service** dialog box, expand the resource group that you're using for this tutorial, and then select the API app that you just created.\n\n    If you don't see the API app in the list, chances are that when you were creating the API app you accidentally omitted the step that changed the type from web app to API app. In that case, you can create a new API app by repeating the steps you did earlier. You'll need to choose a different name for the API app, unless you go to the portal and delete the web app first. \n\n10. Click **OK**.\n\n9. In the **Add REST API Client** dialog box, click **OK**.\n\n    Visual Studio creates a folder named after the API app and generates client classes.\n\n## Update code in ContactsList.API and deploy the project\n\nThe code in ContactsList.API that calls CompanyContacts.API is commented out for the earlier tutorials. In this section you uncomment that code and deploy the app.\n\n1. In the ContactsList.API project, open *Controllers/ContactsController.cs*.\n\n2. Near the top of the `ContactsController` class, in the code that uses the generated client class to add an authorization token, replace the class name `CompanyContactsAPI` with the name of the class generated from your API app.\n\n    For example, if your API app is named CompanyContactsAPI3, the code would look like this:\n\n         private static CompanyContactsAPI3 CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth()\n         {\n             var client = new CompanyContactsAPI3(new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"CompanyContactsAPIUrl\"]));\n             client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =\n                 new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", ServicePrincipal.GetS2SAccessTokenForProdMSA().AccessToken);\n             return client;\n         }\n \n4. In the `Get` method, uncomment the block of code that calls CompanyContacts.API.\n\n        using (var client = CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth())\n        {\n            var results = await client.Contacts.GetAsync();\n            foreach (Contact c in results)\n            {\n                contactsList.Add(c);\n            }\n        }\n\n2. Right-click the ContactsList.API project, and click **Publish**.\n\n    The **Publish Web** wizard opens to the publish profile you used earlier.\n\n3. In the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.\n\n    Visual Studio deploys the project and opens a browser window to the API app base URL. Close this browser window.\n\n## Set up authentication and authorization in Azure for the new API app\n\n1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the API App blade of the API app that you created in this tutorial for the CompanyContacts.API project, and then click **Settings**.\n\n2. Find the **Features** section, and then click **Authentication / Authorization**.\n\n3. In the **Authentication / Authorization** blade, click **On**.\n\n4. In the **Action to take when request is not authenticated** drop-down list, select **Log in with Azure Active Directory**.\n\n5. Under **Authentication Providers**, click **Azure Active Directory**.\n\n6. In the **Azure Active Directory Settings** blade, click **Express**.\n\n    Azure will automatically create an AAD application in your AAD tenant. Make a note of the name of the new AAD application, as you'll select it later when you go to the Azure classic portal to get its client ID.\n\n7. Click **OK**.\n\n10. In the **Authentication / Authorization** blade, click **Save**.\n \n11. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), go to **Azure Active Directory**.\n\n12. On the **Directory** tab, click your AAD tenant.\n\n14. Click **Applications > Application my company owns**, and then click the check mark.\n\n15. In the list of applications, click the name of the one that Azure created for you when you enabled authentication for your API app.\n\n16. Click **Configure**.\n\n17. Keep this page open so you can copy and paste values from it and update values on the page in later steps of the tutorial.\n\n## Update settings in the API app that runs the ContactsList.API project code\n\n3. In another browser window go to the [classic Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), and then go to the **Configure** tab for the AAD application that you created for the ContactsList.API API app.\n\n5. Under **keys**, select **1 year** from the **Select duration** drop-down list.\n\n6. Click **Save**.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/genkey.png)\n\n7. Copy the key value.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/genkeycopy.png)\n\n1. In another browser window, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then navigate to the API app blade for the API app that you deployed the ContactsList.API project to.  (This is the calling API app, not the one being called: ContactsList.API, not CompanyContacts.API.)\n\n2. Click **Settings > Application Settings**.\n\n3. In the **App settings** section, add a key named \"ida:ClientSecret\", and in the value field paste in the key you just created.\n\n3. Add a key named \"ida:ClientId\", and in the value field paste in the client ID from the same AAD **Configure** page.\n\n4. Add a key named \"ida:Authority\", and in the value field enter \"https://login.windows.net/{your tenant}\"; for example,\"https://login.windows.net/contoso.onmicrosoft.com\".\n\n3. In the classic Azure portal, go to the **Configure** tab for the AAD application that you created for the CompanyContacts.API API app.\n\n4. Copy the Client ID.\n\n3. In the Azure portal **Application settings** blade, **App settings** section, add a key named ida:Resource, and in the value field paste in the Client ID you just copied.\n\n4. Add a key named \"CompanyContactsAPIUrl\", and in the value field enter \"https://{your api app name}.azurewebsites.net\", for example:  \"https://companycontactsapi.azurewebsites.net.\"\n\n6. Click Save.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/appsettings.png)\n\n## Test in Azure\n\n1. Go to the URL of the web app that you deployed the ContactsList.Angular.AAD project to.\n\n2. Click the **Contacts** tab, and then log in.\n\n    You see the Contacts page with the additional contacts that have been retrieved from the CompanyContacts.API API app.\n\n    ![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/contactspagewithdavolio.png)\n\nAs was true in the previous tutorial, you can also set up the Visual Studio projects with localhost SSL URLs and run the application locally. In that case, you can store in the Web.config file the settings that you stored in Azure for running in Azure (client ID, client secret, etc.).  However, be careful not to check in to source control a Web.config file that has sensitive information such as the client secret. For more information, see [Best practices for deploying passwords and other sensitive data to ASP.NET and Azure App Service](http://www.asp.net/identity/overview/features-api/best-practices-for-deploying-passwords-and-other-sensitive-data-to-aspnet-and-azure).\n\n## Protect the API app from browser access\n\nFor this tutorial you used the Express option in the Azure portal to set up AAD authentication for the API app that you want to access by using service principal authentication. By default, App Service configures the new AAD application in a way that enables a user to go to the API app's URL in a browser and log on. That means it's possible for an end user, not just a service principal, to access the API. If you only want a service principal to have access to the API, you can prevent browser access by changing the **Reply URL** in the AAD application so that it's different from the API app's base URL. \n\n### Verify browser access works\n\n1. In a new browser window, go to the HTTPS URL of the API app that you created for the CompanyContacts.API project.\n\n    The browser goes to a login screen.\n    \n2. Log in with credentials for a user in your AAD tenant.\n\n3. The browser displays the API app's \"successfully created\" screen. \n\n    If the Swagger UI were enabled you would be able to go to the `/swagger` URL and call the API. You can call the API from the browser by adding `/api/contacts/get` to the URL.\n\n### Disable browser access\n\n1. In the classic portal's **Configure** tab for the AAD application that was created for the CompanyContacts.API project, change the value in the **Reply URL** field so that it is a valid URL but not the API app's URL.\n \n2. Click **Save**.\n\n### Verify browser access no longer works\n\n1. In a new browser window, go to the URL of the API app again.\n\n2. Log in when prompted to do so.\n\n3. Login succeeds but leads to an error page.\n\n    You can still access the API app by using a service principal token, but users in the AAD tenant cannot log in and access the API from a browser.\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis is the last tutorial in the getting started with API Apps series. This section offers additional suggestions for learning more about how to work with API apps.\n\n* Other ways to deploy an App Service app\n\n    For information about other ways to deploy web projects to web apps, by using Visual Studio or by [automating deployment](http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/developing-apps-with-windows-azure/building-real-world-cloud-apps-with-windows-azure/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery) from a [source control system](http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/developing-apps-with-windows-azure/building-real-world-cloud-apps-with-windows-azure/source-control), see [How to deploy an Azure web app](web-sites-deploy.md).\n\n    Visual Studio can also generate Windows PowerShell scripts that you can use to automate deployment. For more information, see [Automate Everything (Building Real-World Cloud Apps with Azure)](http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/developing-apps-with-windows-azure/building-real-world-cloud-apps-with-windows-azure/automate-everything).\n\n* How to troubleshoot an App Service app\n\n    Visual Studio provides features that make it easy to view Azure logs as they are generated in real time. You can also run in debug mode remotely in Azure. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Azure web apps in Visual Studio](web-sites-dotnet-troubleshoot-visual-studio.md).\n\n* How to add a custom domain name and SSL\n\n    For information about how to use SSL and your own domain (for example, www.contoso.com instead of contoso.azurewebsites.net), see the following resources:\n\n    * [Configure a custom domain name in Azure App Service](web-sites-custom-domain-name.md)\n    * [Enable HTTPS for an Azure website](web-sites-configure-ssl-certificate.md)\n\n\n"
