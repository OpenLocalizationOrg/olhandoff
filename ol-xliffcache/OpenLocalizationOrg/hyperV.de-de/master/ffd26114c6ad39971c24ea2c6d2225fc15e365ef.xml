Note that it does not include the names of any specific Azure services, but describes the key elements in a generic IoT solution architecture. In this architecture, IoT devices collect data which they send to a cloud gateway. The cloud gateway makes the data available for processing by other back-end services from where data is delivered to other line-of-business applications or to human operators through a dashboard or other presentation device.\n\n![IoT solution architecture][img-solution-architecture]\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] For an in-depth discussion of IoT architecture see the [Microsoft Azure IoT services: Reference Architecture][lnk-refarch].\n\n### Device connectivity\n\nIn this IoT solution architecture, devices send telemetry, such as temperature readings, to a cloud endpoint for storage and processing.
