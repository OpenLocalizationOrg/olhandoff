You will create both a new mobile app backend and a simple _Todo list_ Xamarin.iOS app that stores app data in Azure.\n\nCompleting this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Xamarin.iOS tutorials about using the Mobile Apps feature in Azure App Service.\n\n##Prerequisites\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you need the following:\n\n* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile apps that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).\n\n* [Visual Studio Community 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) or later.  If you install Visual Studio Community 2013, install [Xamarin] separately.  You can install the Xamarin tools when you install Visual Studio 2015.\n\n* A Mac with [Xcode] v7.0 or later and [Xamarin Studio] installed.\n\n* If you plan to build your app on a Windows-based computer running Visual Studio, you will still need access to a networked Mac running the Xamarin.iOS Build Host to actually build and deploy.
