You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or\nto store application data privately.\n\nCommon uses of Blob storage include:\n\n-   Serving images or documents directly to a browser\n-   Storing files for distributed access\n-   Streaming video and audio\n-   Performing secure backup and disaster recovery\n-   Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service\n\n## Blob service concepts\n\nThe Blob service contains the following components:\n\n![Blob1][Blob1]\n\n-   **Storage Account:** All access to Azure Storage is done\n    through a storage account. See [Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets](storage-scalability-targets.md) for details about storage account capacity.\n\n-   **Container:** A container provides a grouping of a set of blobs.\n    All blobs must be in a container. An account can contain an\n    unlimited number of containers. A container can store an unlimited\n    number of blobs.\n\n-   **Blob:** A file of any type and size. Azure Storage offers three types of blobs: block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs.\n    \n    *Block blobs* are ideal for storing text or binary files, such as documents and media files. *Append blobs* are similar to block blobs in that they are made up of blocks, but they are optimized for append operations, so they are useful for logging scenarios. A single block blob or append blob can contain up to 50,000 blocks of up to 4 MB each, for a total size of slightly more than 195 GB (4 MB X 50,000).\n    \n    *Page blobs* can be up to 1 TB in size, and are more efficient for frequent read/write operations. Azure Virtual Machines use page blobs as OS and data disks.\n\n    For more information about blobs, see [Understanding Block Blobs, Append Blobs, and Page Blobs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee691964.aspx).\n\n## Naming and referencing containers and blobs\n\nYou can address a blob in your storage account using the following URL format:\n   \n    http://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>  \n      \nFor example, here is a URL that addresses one of the blobs in the diagram above:  \n\n    http://sally.blob.core.windows.net/movies/MOV1.AVI\n\n### Container naming rules\n\nA container name must be a valid DNS name and conform to the following rules:\n\n- A container name must be all lowercase.\n- Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.\n- Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.\n- Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.\n\n### Blob naming rules\n\nA blob name must conform to the following rules:\n\n- A blob name can contain any combination of characters.\n- A blob name must be at least one character long and cannot be more than 1,024 characters long.\n- Blob names are case-sensitive.\n- Reserved URL characters must be properly escaped.\n- The number of path segments comprising the blob name cannot exceed 254. A path segment is the string between consecutive delimiter characters (*e.g.*, the forward slash '/') that corresponds to the name of a virtual directory.\n\nThe Blob service is based on a flat storage scheme. You can create a virtual hierarchy by specifying a character or string delimiter within the blob name to create a virtual hierarchy. For example, the following list shows some valid and unique blob names:\n\n    /a\n    /a.txt\n    /a/b\n    /a/b.txt\n\nYou can use the delimiter character to list blobs hierarchically.\n\n\n[Blob1]: ./media/storage-blob-concepts-include/blob1.jpg\n\n"
