For example, you may want to get insight into how users are registering for password reset, or how many password resets have been done in the last few days.  Here are some of the common questions that you will be able to answer with the Password Management reports that exist in the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) today:\n\n- How many people have registered for password reset?\n- Who has registered for password reset?\n- What data are people registering?\n- How many people reset their passwords in the last 7 days?\n- What are the most common methods users or admins use to reset their passwords?\n- What are common issues users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?\n- What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?\n- Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?\n\n\n## How to view Password Management reports\nTo find the Password Management reports, follow the steps below:\n\n1.  Click on the **Active Directory** extension in the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).\n2.  Select your directory from the list that appears in the portal.\n3.  Click on the **Reports** tab.\n4.  Look under the **Activity Logs** section.\n5.  Select either the **Password reset activity** report or the **Password reset registration activity** report.\n\n    ![][001]\n\n## How to access Password Management Reports from an API\nAs of August 2015, the Azure AD Reports and Events now supports retrieving all of the information included in the Password Reset and Password Reset Registration reports.\n\nTo access this data, you'll need to write a small app or script to retrieve it from our servers. [Learn how to get started with the Azure AD Reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md).\n\nOnce you have a working script, you'll next want to examine the password reset and registration events that you can retrieve to meet your scenarios.\n\n- [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset events\n- [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset registration events\n\n## View password Reset registration activity\n\nThe password reset registration activity report shows all password reset registrations that have occurred in your organization.  A password reset registration is displayed in this report for any user who has successfully registered authentication information at the password reset registration portal ([http://aka.ms/ssprsetup](http://aka.ms/ssprsetup)).\n\n- **Max time range**: 1 month\n- **Max number of rows**: unlimited\n- **Downloadable**: Yes, via CSV file\n\n    ![][002]\n\n### Description of report columns\nThe following list explains each of the report columns in detail:\n\n- **User** – the user who attempted a password reset registration operation.\n- **Role** – the role of the user in the directory.\n- **Date and Time** – the date and time of the attempt.\n- **Data Registered** – what authentication data the user provided during password reset registration.\n\n### Description of report values\nThe following table describes the different values allowed for each column:\n\nColumn|Allowed values and their meanings\n---|---\nData Registered| **Alternate Email** – user used alternate email or authentication email to authenticate<p><p>**Office Phone**– user used office phone to authenticate<p>**Mobile Phone** - user used mobile phone or authentication phone to authenticate<p>**Security Questions** – user used security questions to authenticate<p>**Any combination of the above (e.g. Alternate Email + Mobile Phone)** – occurs when a 2 gate policy is specified and shows which two methods the user used to authentication his password reset request.\n\n## View password reset activity\n\nThis report shows all password reset attempts that have occurred in your organization.\n\n- **Max time range**: 1 month\n- **Max number of rows**: unlimited\n- **Downloadable**: Yes, via CSV file\n\n    ![][003]\n\n### Description of report columns\nThe following list explains each of the report columns in detail:\n\n1. **User** – the user who attempted a password reset operation (based on the User ID field provided when the user comes to reset a password).\n2. **Role** – the role of the user in the directory.\n3. **Date and Time** – the date and time of the attempt.\n4. **Method(s) Used** – what authentication methods the user used for this reset operation.\n5. **Result** – the end result of the password reset operation.\n6. **Details** – the details of why the password reset resulted in the value it did.  Also includes any mitigation steps you might take to resolve an unexpected error.\n\n### Description of report values\nThe following table describes the different values allowed for each column:\n\nColumn|Allowed values and their meanings\n---|---\nMethods Used|**Alternate Email** – user used alternate email or authentication email to authenticate<p>**Office Phone** – user used office phone to authenticate<p>**Mobile Phone** – user used mobile phone or authentication phone to authenticate<p>**Security Questions** – user used security questions to authenticate<p>**Any combination of the above (e.g. Alternate Email + Mobile Phone)** – occurs when a 2 gate policy is specified and shows which two methods the user used to authentication his password reset request.\nResult|**Abandoned** – user started password reset but then stopped halfway through without completing<p>**Blocked** – user’s account was prevented to use password reset due to attempting to use the password reset page or a single password reset gate too many times in a 24 hour period<p>**Cancelled** – user started password reset but then clicked the cancel button to cancel the session part way through <p>**Contacted Admin** – user had a problem during his session that he could not resolve, so the user clicked the “Contact your administrator” link instead of finishing the password reset flow<p>**Failed** – user was not able to reset a password, likely because the user was not configured to use the feature (e.g. no license, missing authentication info, password managed on-prem but writeback is off).<p>**Succeeded** – password reset was successful.\nDetails|See table below\n\n### Allowed values for details column\nBelow is the list of result types you may expect when using the password reset activity report:\n\nDetails | Result Type\n----|----\nUser abandoned after completing the email verification option  | Abandoned\nUser abandoned after completing the mobile SMS verification option|Abandoned\nUser abandoned after completing the mobile voice call verification option | Abandoned\nUser abandoned after completing the office voice call verification option | Abandoned\nUser abandoned after completing the security questions option|Abandoned\nUser abandoned after entering their user ID| Abandoned\nUser abandoned after starting the email verification option|Abandoned\nUser abandoned after starting the mobile SMS verification option|Abandoned\nUser abandoned after starting the mobile voice call verification option|Abandoned\nUser abandoned after starting the office voice call verification option|Abandoned\nUser abandoned after starting the security questions option| Abandoned\nUser abandoned before selecting a new password| Abandoned\nUser abandoned while selecting a new password| Abandoned\nUser entered too many invalid SMS verification codes and is blocked for 24 hours|Blocked\nUser tried mobile phone voice verification too many times and is blocked for 24 hours|Blocked\nUser tried office phone voice verification too many times and is blocked for 24 hours |Blocked\nUser tried to answer security questions too many times and is blocked for 24 hours| Blocked\nUser tried to verify a phone number too many times and is blocked for 24 hours|Blocked\nUser cancelled before passing the required authentication methods|Cancelled\nUser cancelled before submitting a new password|Cancelled\nUser contacted an admin after trying the email verification option |Contacted admin\nUser contacted an admin after trying the mobile SMS verification option|Contacted admin\nUser contacted an admin after trying the mobile voice call verification option|Contacted admin\nUser contacted an admin after trying the office voice call verification option |Contacted admin\nUser contacted an admin after trying the security question verification option|Contacted admin\nPassword reset is not enabled for this user.
