Specify the language, and then press Enter. \n\n    ![StorSimple configure and register device 1](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_RegisterYourDevice1-U1-include.png)\n\n4.

For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-configure-web-proxy.md).\n\n9. Configure a Primary NTP server for your device. NTP servers are required, as your device must synchronize time so that it can authenticate with your cloud service providers.
