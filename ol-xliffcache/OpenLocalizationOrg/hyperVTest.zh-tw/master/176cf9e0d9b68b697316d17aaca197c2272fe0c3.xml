You will add push notifications to the quickstart project that is a prerequisite for this tutorial. Push notifications are enabled by using the Azure Notification Hub that is included in your mobile service. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-prerequisites](../../includes/mobile-services-android-prerequisites.md)]\n\n## Sample code\nTo see the completed source code go [here](https://github.com/Azure/mobile-services-samples/tree/master/GettingStartedWithPush).\n\n## Enable Google Cloud Messaging\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-enable-Google-cloud-messaging](../../includes/mobile-services-enable-google-cloud-messaging.md)]\n\n## Configure Mobile Services to send push requests\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-configure-push](../../includes/mobile-services-android-configure-push.md)]\n\n## Add push notifications to your app\n\n\n\nYour next step is to install Google Play services. Google Cloud Messaging has some minimum API level requirements for development and testing, which the **minSdkVersion** property in the Manifest must conform to.\n\nIf you will be testing with an older device, then consult [Set Up Google Play Services SDK] to determine how low you can set this value, and set it appropriately.\n\n###Add Google Play Services to the project\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [Add Play Services](../../includes/mobile-services-add-google-play-services.md)]\n\n###Add code\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-push](../../includes/mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-push.md)]\n\n\n## Update the registered insert script in the Azure classic portal\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-push-insert-script](../../includes/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-push-insert-script.md)]\n\n\n## Test push notifications in your app\n\nYou can test the app by directly attaching an Android phone with a USB cable, or by using a virtual device in the emulator.\n\n###Setting up the Android emulator for testing\n\nWhen you run this app in the emulator, make sure that you use an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that supports Google APIs.\n\n1. From the right end of the toolbar, select the Android Virtual Device Manager, select your device, click the edit icon on the right.\n\n    ![](./media/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-android-virtual-device-manager.png)\n\n2. Select **Change** on the device description line, select **Google APIs**,  then click OK.\n\n    ![](./media/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-android-virtual-device-manager-edit.png)\n\n    This targets the AVD to use Google APIs.\n\n###Running the test\n\n1. From the **Run** menu item, click **Run app** to start the app.\n\n2. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _A new Mobile Services task_ and then click the **Add** button.\n\n    ![](./media/mobile-services-javascript-backend-android-get-started-push/mobile-quickstart-push1-android.png)\n\n3. Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the device's Notification Drawer to see the notification.\n\n\nYou have successfully completed this tutorial.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Verify Android SDK Version\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [Verify SDK](../../includes/mobile-services-verify-android-sdk-version.md)]\n\n## Next steps\n\n<!---This tutorial demonstrated the basics of enabling an Android app to use Mobile Services and Notification Hubs to send push notifications.
