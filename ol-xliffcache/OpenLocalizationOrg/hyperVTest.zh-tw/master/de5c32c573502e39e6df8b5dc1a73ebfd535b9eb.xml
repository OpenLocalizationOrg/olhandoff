In this tutorial you add server side scripts to send email using SendGrid. When complete, your mobile service will send an email each time a record is inserted.\n\nSendGrid is a [cloud-based email service] that provides reliable [transactional email delivery], scalability, and real-time analytics along with flexible APIs that make custom integration easy. For more information, see <http://sendgrid.com>.\n\nThis tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable email functionality:\n\n1. [Create a SendGrid account]\n2. [Add a script to send email]\n3. [Insert data to receive email]\n\nThis tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services].\n\n## <a name=\"sign-up\"></a>Create a new SendGrid account\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [sendgrid-sign-up](../../includes/sendgrid-sign-up.md)]\n\n## <a name=\"add-script\"></a>Register a new script that sends emails\n\n1. Log on to the [Azure classic portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.\n\n2. In the Azure classic portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table.\n\n    ![][1]\n\n3. In **todoitem**, click the **Script** tab and select **Insert**.\n\n    ![][2]\n\n    This displays the function that is invoked when an insert occurs in the **TodoItem** table.\n\n4. Replace the insert function with the following code:\n\n        var SendGrid = require('sendgrid').SendGrid;\n\n        function insert(item, user, request) {\n            request.execute({\n                success: function() {\n                    // After the record has been inserted, send the response immediately to the client\n                    request.respond();\n                    // Send the email in the background\n                    sendEmail(item);\n                }\n            });\n\n            function sendEmail(item) {\n                var sendgrid = new SendGrid('**username**', '**password**');\n\n                sendgrid.send({\n                    to: '**email-address**',\n                    from: '**from-address**',\n                    subject: 'New to-do item',\n                    text: 'A new to-do was added: ' + item.text\n                }, function(success, message) {\n                    // If the email failed to send, log it as an error so we can investigate\n                    if (!success) {\n                        console.error(message);\n                    }\n                });\n            }\n        }\n\n5. Replace the placeholders in the above script with the correct values:\n\n    - **_username_ and _password_**: the SendGrid credentials you identified in [Create a SendGrid account].\n\n    - **_email-address_**: the address that the email is sent to. In a real-world app, you can use tables to store and retrieve email addresses.

Consider using a registered domain address that belongs to your organization.\n\n     > [AZURE.NOTE] If you do not have a registered domain, you can instead use the domain of your Mobile Service, in the format *notifications@_your-mobile-service_.azure-mobile.net*. However, messages sent to your mobile service domain are ignored.\n\n6. Click the **Save** button.
