title: Step 3: Create a virtual switch

# Step 3: Create a virtual switch 

Before creating a virtual machine in Hyper-V you will need to provide a way for this virtual machine to connect to a physical network. Hyper-V includes software based networking technology that allows a virtual machines network card to connect to a virtual switch, providing network connectivity. Each virtual switch created in Hyper-V can be configured with one of three connection types:

- External Network – the virtual switch is connected to a physical network adapted which provides connectivity between the physical network, the Hyper-V host, and the virtual machine. In this configuration you can also enable or disable the hosts ability to communicate over the physically connected network card. This can be useful to isolate only VM traffic to a particular physical network card.
- Internal Network – the virtual switch is not connected to a physical network adapter, however network connectivity exists between virtual machines and Hyper-V host.
- Private Network – the virtual switch is not connected to a physical network adapter and connectivity does not exist between virtual machines and Hyper-V host.

This walkthrough will detail working with an external network.

##Manually Create a Virtual Switch

This exercise will walk through creating a virtual switch with full network connectivity using the Hyper-V management tools. When completed your Hyper-V host will contain a virtual switch that can be used to connect virtual machines to a physical network. 

1. Open up Hyper-V Manager.

2. Right Click on the name of the Hyper-V host and select ‘Virtual Switch Manager’.

3. Under ‘Virtual Switches’ select ‘new virtual network switch’.

4. Under ‘Create virtual switch’ select ‘External’.
5. Select the ‘Create Virtual Switch’ button.

6. Under ‘Virtual Switch Properties’ give the new switch a name such as ‘External VM Switch’.

7. Under ‘Connection Type’ ensure that ‘External Network’ has been selected.

8. Select the physical network card that will be paired with the new virtual switch, this will be the network card that is physically connected to the network.

9. Select ‘Apply’ to create the virtual switch. At this point you will most likely see the following message, click ‘Yes’ to continue.

10. Select ‘OK’ to close the Virtual Switch Manager Window.

## Create a Virtual Switch with PowerShell

The following steps can be used to create a virtual switch with an external connection using PowerShell. 

1. Use `Get-NetAdapter` to return a list of network adapters connected to the Windows 10 system.  

	```
	PS C:\> Get-NetAdapter

	Name                      InterfaceDescription                    ifIndex Status       MacAddress             LinkSpeed
	----                      --------------------                    ------- ------       ----------             ---------
	Ethernet 2                Broadcom NetXtreme 57xx Gigabit Cont...       5 Up           BC-30-5B-A8-C1-7F         1 Gbps
	Ethernet                  Intel(R) PRO/100 M Desktop Adapter            3 Up           00-0E-0C-A8-DC-31        10 Mbps  
	```

2. Select the network adapter to use with the Hyper-V switch and place an instance in a variable named `$NetAdapter`.

	```
	$net = Get-NetAdapter -Name 'Ethernet'
	```

3.	Execute the following command to create the new Hyper-V virtual switch.

	```
	New-VMSwitch -Name "External VM Switch" -AllowManagementOS $True -NetAdapterName $net.Name
	```

## Notes on Virtual Switches and Laptops:

If running Windows 10 Hyper-V on a laptop you may want to consider creating a virtual switch for both the Ethernet and wireless network card. With this configuration you can change your virtual machines between theses switches dependent on the laptop is network connected. Virtual machines will not automatically switch between wired and wireless.
