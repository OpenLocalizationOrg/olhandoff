This web service runs an Azure Machine Learning experiment with an underlying R script. There are 2 parts to this experiment: schema definition, and training model + scoring. The first module defines the expected structure of the input dataset, where the first variable is the dependent variable and the remaining variables are independent. The second module fits a generic logistic regression model for the input data.    \n\n![Experiment flow][2]\n\n####Module 1:\n\n    #Schema definition  \n    data <- data.frame(value = \"1;2;3,1;5;6,0;8;9\", stringsAsFactors=FALSE) \n    maml.mapOutputPort(\"data\");  \n\n####Module 2:\n    #GLM modeling   \n    data <- maml.mapInputPort(1) # class: data.frame  \n    \n    data.split <- strsplit(data[1,1], \",\")[[1]] \n    data.split <- sapply(data.split, strsplit, \";\", simplify = TRUE) \n    data.split <- sapply(data.split, strsplit, \";\", simplify = TRUE) \n    data.split <- as.data.frame(t(data.split)) data.split <- \n    data.matrix(data.split) \n    data.split <- data.frame(data.split) \n    \n    model <- glm(data.split$V1 ~., family='binomial', data=data.split)  \n    out <- data.frame(predict(model,data.split, type=\"response\")) \n    pred1 <- as.data.frame(out) \n    group <- array(1:nrow(pred1)) \n    for (i in 1:nrow(pred1))  \n        {\n        if(as.numeric(pred1[i,])>0.5) {group[i]=1} \n        else {group[i]=0}\n        } \n    pred2 <- as.data.frame(group) \n    maml.mapOutputPort(\"pred2\");  \n\n\n##Limitations\nThis is a very simple example of a binary classification web service. As can be seen from the example code above, no error catching is implemented and the service assumes everything is a binary/continuous variable (no categorical features allowed), as the service only inputs numeric values at the time of the creation of this web service. Also, the service currently handles limited data size, due to the request/response nature of the web service call and the fact that the model is being fit every time the web service is called. \n\n##FAQ\nFor frequently asked questions on consumption of the web service or publishing to the Azure Marketplace, see [here](machine-learning-marketplace-faq.md).\n\n[1]: ./media/machine-learning-r-csharp-binary-classifier/binary1.png\n[2]: ./media/machine-learning-r-csharp-binary-classifier/binary2.png\n\n\n<!-- Module References -->\n[execute-r-script]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/30806023-392b-42e0-94d6-6b775a6e0fd5/\n \n"
