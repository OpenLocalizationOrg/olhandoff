If you have multiple certificates, make a note of the subject, or the last four characters of the thumbprint, which are used to select the certificate when configuring an API to use certificates, as covered in the following [Configure an API to use a client certificate for gateway authentication][] section.\n\n## <a name=\"step1a\"> </a>Delete a client certificate\n\nTo delete a certificate, click **Delete** beside the desired certificate.\n\n![Delete certificate][api-management-certificate-delete]\n\nClick **Yes, delete it** to confirm.\n\n![Confirm delete][api-management-confirm-delete]\n\nIf the certificate is in use by an API, then a warning screen is displayed. To delete the certificate you must first remove the certificate from any APIs that are configured to use it.\n\n![Confirm delete][api-management-confirm-delete-policy]\n\n## <a name=\"step2\"> </a>Configure an API to use a client certificate for gateway authentication\n\nClick **APIs** from the **API Management** menu on the left, click the name of the desired API, and click the **Security** tab.\n\n![API security][api-management-api-security]\n\nSelect **Client certificates** from the **With credentials** drop-down list.\n\n![Client certificates][api-management-mutual-certificates]\n\nSelect the desired certificate from the **Client certificate** drop-down list. If there are multiple certificates you can look at the subject or the last four characters of the thumbprint as noted in the previous section to determine the correct certificate.\n\n![Select certificate][api-management-select-certificate]\n\nClick **Save** to save the configuration change to the API.\n\n>This change is effective immediately, and calls to operations of that API will use the certificate to authenticate on the back-end server.\n\n![Save API changes][api-management-save-api]\n\n>When a certificate is specified for gateway authentication for the back-end service of an API, it becomes part of the policy for that API, and can be viewed in the policy editor.\n\n![Certificate policy][api-management-certificate-policy]\n\n## Next steps\n\nFor more information on other ways to secure your backend service, such as HTTP basic or shared secret authentication, see the following video.\n\n> [AZURE.VIDEO last-mile-security]\n\n[api-management-management-console]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-management-console.png\n[api-management-security-client-certificates]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-security-client-certificates.png\n[api-management-upload-certificate]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-upload-certificate.png\n[api-management-upload-certificate-form]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-upload-certificate-form.png\n[api-management-certificate-uploaded]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-certificate-uploaded.png\n[api-management-api-security]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-api-security.png\n[api-management-mutual-certificates]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-mutual-certificates.png\n[api-management-select-certificate]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-select-certificate.png\n[api-management-save-api]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-save-api.png\n[api-management-certificate-policy]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-certificate-policy.png\n[api-management-certificate-delete]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-certificate-delete.png\n[api-management-confirm-delete]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-confirm-delete.png\n[api-management-confirm-delete-policy]: ./media/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates/api-management-confirm-delete-policy.png\n\n\n\n[How to add operations to an API]: api-management-howto-add-operations.md\n[How to add and publish a product]: api-management-howto-add-products.md\n[Monitoring and analytics]: ../api-management-monitoring.md\n[Add APIs to a product]: api-management-howto-add-products.md#add-apis\n[Publish a product]: api-management-howto-add-products.md#publish-product\n[Get started with Azure API Management]: api-management-get-started.md\n[Get started with advanced API configuration]: api-management-get-started-advanced.md\n[API Management policy reference]: api-management-policy-reference.md\n[Caching policies]: api-management-policy-reference.md#caching-policies\n[Create an API Management service instance]: api-management-get-started.md#create-service-instance\n\n[Azure API Management REST API Certificate entity]: http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783483.aspx\n[WebApp-GraphAPI-DotNet]: https://github.com/AzureADSamples/WebApp-GraphAPI-DotNet\n\n[Prerequisites]: #prerequisites\n[Upload a client certificate]: #step1\n[Delete a client certificate]: #step1a\n[Configure an API to use a client certificate for gateway authentication]: #step2\n[Test the configuration by calling an operation in the Developer Portal]: #step3\n[Next steps]: #next-steps\n\n\n\n "
