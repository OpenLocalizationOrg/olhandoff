The mobile service that you will create uses the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio for server-side business logic and to manage the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the [JavaScript backend version](mobile-services-android-get-started.md) of this topic.\n\nA screenshot from the completed app is below:\n\n![](./media/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-android-get-started/mobile-quickstart-completed-android.png)\n\nCompleting this tutorial requires the [Android Developer Tools][Android Studio], which includes the Android Studio integrated development environment, and the latest Android platform.
