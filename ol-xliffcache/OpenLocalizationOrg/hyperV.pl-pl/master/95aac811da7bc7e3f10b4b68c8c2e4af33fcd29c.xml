For instructions on how to integrate with the generally available Azure AD service, please refer to the [Azure Active Directory Developer Guide](active-directory-developers-guide.md).\n\n\nHere we'll use Passport to:\n\n- Sign the user into the app using Azure AD and the v2.0 app model.\n- Display some information about the user.\n- Sign the user out of the app.\n\n**Passport** is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based or Resitify web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more. We have developed a strategy for Microsoft Azure Active Directory. We will install this module and then add the Microsoft Azure Active Directory `passport-azure-ad` plug-in.\n\nIn order to do this, you'll need to:\n\n1. Register an app.\n2. Set up your app to use the Passport-azure-ad strategy.\n3. Use Passport to issue sign-in and sign-out requests to Azure AD.\n4. Print out data about the user.\n\nThe code for this tutorial is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs).  To follow along, you can [download the app's skeleton as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs/archive/skeleton.zip) or clone the skeleton:\n\n```git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs.git```\n\nThe completed application is provided at the end of this tutorial as well.\n\n## 1. Register an App\nCreate a new app at [apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com), or follow these [detailed steps](active-directory-v2-app-registration.md).  Make sure to:\n\n- Copy down the **Application Id** assigned to your app, you'll need it soon.\n- Add the **Web** platform for your app.\n- Enter the correct **Redirect URI**. The redirect URI indicates to Azure AD where authentication responses should be directed - the default for this tutorial is `http://localhost:3000/auth/openid/return`.\n\n## 2. Add pre-requisities to your directory\n\nFrom the command-line, change directories to your root folder if not already there and run the following commands:\n\n- `npm install express`\n- `npm install ejs`\n- `npm install ejs-locals`\n- `npm install restify`\n- `npm install mongoose`\n- `npm install bunyan`\n- `npm install assert-plus`\n- `npm install passport`\n- `npm install webfinger`\n- `npm install body-parser`\n- `npm install express-session`\n- `npm install cookie-parser`\n\n- In addition, we've use `passport-azure-ad` for our Preview in the skeleton of the quickstart.\n\n- `npm install passport-azure-ad`\n\n\nThis will install the libraries that passport-azure-ad depend on.\n\n## 3. Set up your app to use the passport-node-js strategy\nHere, we'll configure the Express middleware to use the OpenID Connect authentication protocol.  Passport will be used to issue sign-in and sign-out requests, manage the user's session, and get information about the user, amongst other things.\n\n-   To begin, open the `config.js` file in the root of the project, and enter your app's configuration values in the `exports.creds` section.\n    -   The `clientID:` is the **Application Id** assigned to your app in the registration portal.\n    -   The `returnURL` is the **Redirect URI** you entered in the portal.\n    - The `clientSecret` is the secret you generated in the portal.\n\n- Next open `app.js` file in the root of the proejct and add the follwing call to invoke the `OIDCStrategy` strategy that comes with `passport-azure-ad`\n\n\n```JavaScript\nvar OIDCStrategy = require('passport-azure-ad').OIDCStrategy;\n\n// Add some logging\nvar log = bunyan.createLogger({\n    name: 'Microsoft OIDC Example Web Application'\n});\n```\n\n- After that, use the strategy we just referenced to handle our login requests\n\n```JavaScript\n// Use the OIDCStrategy within Passport. (Section 2)\n//\n//   Strategies in passport require a `validate` function, which accept\n//   credentials (in this case, an OpenID identifier), and invoke a callback\n//   with a user object.\npassport.use(new OIDCStrategy({\n    callbackURL: config.creds.returnURL,\n    realm: config.creds.realm,\n    clientID: config.creds.clientID,\n    clientSecret: config.creds.clientSecret,\n    oidcIssuer: config.creds.issuer,\n    identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,\n    responseType: config.creds.responseType,\n    responseMode: config.creds.responseMode,\n    skipUserProfile: config.creds.skipUserProfile\n    //scope: config.creds.scope\n  },\n  function(iss, sub, profile, accessToken, refreshToken, done) {\n    log.info('Example: Email address we received was: ', profile.email);\n    // asynchronous verification, for effect...\n    process.nextTick(function () {\n      findByEmail(profile.email, function(err, user) {\n        if (err) {\n          return done(err);\n        }\n        if (!user) {\n          // \"Auto-registration\"\n          users.push(profile);\n          return done(null, profile);\n        }\n        return done(null, user);\n      });\n    });\n  }\n));\n```\nPassport uses a similar pattern for all it’s Strategies (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) that all Strategy writers adhere to. Looking at the strategy you see we pass it a function() that has a token and a done as the parameters. The strategy will dutifully come back to us once it does all it’s work. Once it does we’ll want to store the user and stash the token so we won’t need to ask for it again.\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]\nThe code above takes any user that happens to authenticate to our server. This is known as auto registration. In production servers you wouldn’t want to let anyone in without first having them go through a registration process you decide. This is usually the pattern you see in consumer apps who allow you to register with Facebook but then ask you to fill out additional information. If this wasn’t a sample application, we could have just extracted the email from the token object that is returned and then asked them to fill out additional information. Since this is a test server we simply add them to the in-memory database.\n\n- Next, let's add the methods that will allow us to keep track of the logged in users as required by Passport. This includes serializing and deserializing the user's information:\n\n```JavaScript\n\n// Passport session setup. (Section 2)\n\n//   To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to\n//   serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  Typically,\n//   this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding\n//   the user by ID when deserializing.\npassport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {\n  done(null, user.email);\n});\n\npassport.deserializeUser(function(id, done) {\n  findByEmail(id, function (err, user) {\n    done(err, user);\n  });\n});\n\n// array to hold logged in users\nvar users = [];\n\nvar findByEmail = function(email, fn) {\n  for (var i = 0, len = users.length; i < len; i++) {\n    var user = users[i];\n    log.info('we are using user: ', user);\n    if (user.email === email) {\n      return fn(null, user);\n    }\n  }\n  return fn(null, null);\n};\n\n```\n\n- Next, let's add the code to load the express engine. Here you see we use the default /views and /routes pattern that Express provides.\n\n```JavaScript\n\n// configure Express (Section 2)\n\nvar app = express();\n\n\napp.configure(function() {\n  app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');\n  app.set('view engine', 'ejs');\n  app.use(express.logger());\n  app.use(express.methodOverride());\n  app.use(cookieParser());\n  app.use(expressSession({ secret: 'keyboard cat', resave: true, saveUninitialized: false }));\n  app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended : true }));\n  // Initialize Passport!  Also use passport.session() middleware, to support\n  // persistent login sessions (recommended).\n  app.use(passport.initialize());\n  app.use(passport.session());\n  app.use(app.router);\n  app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/../../public'));\n});\n\n```\n\n- Finally, let's add the POST routes that will hand off the actual login requests to the `passport-azure-ad` engine:\n\n```JavaScript\n\n// Our Auth routes (Section 3)\n\n// GET /auth/openid\n//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the\n//   request.  The first step in OpenID authentication will involve redirecting\n//   the user to their OpenID provider.  After authenticating, the OpenID\n//   provider will redirect the user back to this application at\n//   /auth/openid/return\n\napp.get('/auth/openid',\n  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n  function(req, res) {\n    log.info('Authenitcation was called in the Sample');\n    res.redirect('/');\n  });\n\n// GET /auth/openid/return\n//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the\n//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the\n//   login page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,\n//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.\napp.get('/auth/openid/return',\n  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n  function(req, res) {\n\n    res.redirect('/');\n  });\n\n// POST /auth/openid/return\n//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the\n//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the\n//   login page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,\n//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.\n\napp.post('/auth/openid/return',\n  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n  function(req, res) {\n\n    res.redirect('/');\n  });\n```\n\n## 4. Use Passport to issue sign-in and sign-out requests to Azure AD\n\nYour app is now properly configured to communicate with the v2.0 endpoint using the OpenID Connect authentication protocol.  `passport-azure-ad` has taken care of all of the ugly details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session.  All that remains is to give your users a way to sign in, sign out, and gather additional info on the logged in user.\n\n- First, lets add the default, login, account, and logout methods to our `app.js` file:\n\n```JavaScript\n\n//Routes (Section 4)\n\napp.get('/', function(req, res){\n  res.render('index', { user: req.user });\n});\n\napp.get('/account', ensureAuthenticated, function(req, res){\n  res.render('account', { user: req.user });\n});\n\napp.get('/login',\n  passport.authenticate('azuread-openidconnect', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),\n  function(req, res) {\n    log.info('Login was called in the Sample');\n    res.redirect('/');\n});\n\napp.get('/logout', function(req, res){\n  req.logout();\n  res.redirect('/');\n});\n\n```\n\n-   Let's review these in detail:\n    -   The `/` route will redirect to the index.ejs view passing the user in the request (if it exists)\n    - The `/account` route will first ***ensure we are authenticated*** (we implement that below) and then pass the user in the request so that we can get additional information about the user.\n    - The `/login` route will call our azuread-openidconnect authenticator from `passport-azuread` and if that doesn't succeed will redirect the user back to /login\n    - The `/logout` will simply call the logout.ejs (and route) which clears cookies and then return the user back to index.ejs\n\n\n- For the last part of `app.js`, let's add the EnsureAuthenticated method that is used in `/account` above.\n\n```JavaScript\n\n// Simple route middleware to ensure user is authenticated. (Section 4)\n\n//   Use this route middleware on any resource that needs to be protected.  If\n//   the request is authenticated (typically via a persistent login session),\n//   the request will proceed.  Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the\n//   login page.\nfunction ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {\n  if (req.isAuthenticated()) { return next(); }\n  res.redirect('/login')\n}\n\n```\n\n- Finally, let's actually create the server itself in `app.js`:\n\n```JavaScript\n\napp.listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n\n## 5. Create the views and routes in express to display our user in the website\n\nWe have our `app.js` complete. Now we simply need to add the routes and views that will show the information we get to the user as well as handle the `/logout` and `/login` routes we've created.\n\n- Create the `/routes/index.js` route under the root directory.\n\n```JavaScript\n\n/*\n * GET home page.\n */\n\nexports.index = function(req, res){\n  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });\n};\n```\n\n- Create the `/routes/user.js` route under the root directory\n\n```JavaScript\n\n/*\n * GET users listing.\n */\n\nexports.list = function(req, res){\n  res.send(\"respond with a resource\");\n};\n```\n\nThese simple routes will just pass along the request to our views, including the user if present.\n\n- Create the `/views/index.ejs` view under the root directory. this is a simple page that will call our login and logout methods and allow us to grab account information. Notice that we can use the conditional `if (!user)` as the user being passed through in the request is evidence we have a logged in user.\n\n```JavaScript\n<% if (!user) { %>\n    <h2>Welcome! Please log in.</h2>\n    <a href=\"/login\">Log In</a>\n<% } else { %>\n    <h2>Hello, <%= user.displayName %>.</h2>\n    <a href=\"/account\">Account Info</a></br>\n    <a href=\"/logout\">Log Out</a>\n<% } %>\n```\n\n- Create the `/views/account.ejs` view under the root directory so that we can view additional information that `passport-azuread` has put in the user request.\n\n```Javascript\n<% if (!user) { %>\n    <h2>Welcome! Please log in.</h2>\n    <a href=\"/login\">Log In</a>\n<% } else { %>\n<p>displayName: <%= user.displayName %></p>\n<p>givenName: <%= user.name.givenName %></p>\n<p>familyName: <%= user.name.familyName %></p>\n<p>UPN: <%= user._json.upn %></p>\n<p>Profile ID: <%= user.id %></p>\n<p>Full Claimes</p>\n<%- JSON.stringify(user) %>\n<p></p>\n<a href=\"/logout\">Log Out</a>\n<% } %>\n```\n\n- Finally, let's make this look pretty by adding a layout. Create the '/views/layout.ejs' view under the root directory\n\n```HTML\n\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <title>Passport-OpenID Example</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <% if (!user) { %>\n            <p>\n            <a href=\"/\">Home</a> |\n            <a href=\"/login\">Log In</a>\n            </p>\n        <% } else { %>\n            <p>\n            <a href=\"/\">Home</a> |\n            <a href=\"/account\">Account</a> |\n            <a href=\"/logout\">Log Out</a>\n            </p>\n        <% } %>\n        <%- body %>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFinally, build and run your app!\n\nRun `node app.js` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`\n\n\nSign in with either a personal Microsoft Account or a work or school account, and notice how the user's identity is reflected in the /account list.  You now have a web app secured using industry standard protocols that can authenticate users with both their personal and work/school accounts.\n\n##Next Steps\n\nFor reference, the completed sample (without your configuration values) [is provided as a .zip here](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs/archive/complete.zip), or you can clone it from GitHub:\n\n```git clone --branch complete https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-OpenIDConnect-nodejs.git```\n\nYou can now move onto more advanced topics.
