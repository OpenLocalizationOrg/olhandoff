A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the device identity registry. Refer to the **Device Identity Registry** section of the [IoT Hub Developer Guide][lnk-devguide-identity] for more information. When you run this console application, it generates a unique device ID and key that your device can identify itself with when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.\n\n1. In Visual Studio, add a new Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution using the **Console  Application** project template. Name the project **CreateDeviceIdentity**.\n\n    ![][10]\n\n2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **CreateDeviceIdentity** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**.\n\n3. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, make sure the **Include prerelease** option is checked. Then search for **Microsoft Azure Devices**, click **Install**, and accept the terms of use.\n\n    ![][11]\n\n4.

Add the following `using` statements at the top of the **Program.cs** file:\n\n        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;\n        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Common.Exceptions;\n\n5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class, replacing the placeholder value with the connection string for the IoT hub you created in the previous section:\n\n        static RegistryManager registryManager;\n        static string connectionString = \"{iothub connection string}\";\n\n6.

An IoT hub exposes an [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs-overview]-compatible endpoint to enable you to read device-to-cloud messages. To keep things simple, this tutorial creates a basic reader that is not suitable for a high throughput deployment. The [Process device-to-cloud messages][lnk-processd2c-tutorial] tutorial shows you how to process device-to-cloud messages at scale and the [Get Started with Event Hubs][lnk-eventhubs-tutorial] tutorial provides further information on how to process messages from Event Hubs.\n\n1. In Visual Studio, add a new Visual C# Windows Classic Desktop project to the current solution using the **Console  Application** project template. Name the project **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages**.\n\n    ![][10]\n\n2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**.\n\n3. In the **NuGet Package Manager** window, make sure the **Include prerelease** option is checked. Then search for **WindowsAzure.ServiceBus**, click **Install**, and accept the terms of use.\n\n    This downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure Service Bus][lnk-servicebus-nuget], with all its dependencies.\n\n4. Add the following `using` statement at the top of the **Program.cs** file:\n\n        using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;\n\n5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class, replacing the placeholder value with the connection string for the IoT hub you created in the *Create an IoT hub* section:\n\n        static string connectionString = \"{iothub connection string}\";\n        static string iotHubD2cEndpoint = \"messages/events\";\n        static EventHubClient eventHubClient;\n\n6.

Partition: {0} Data: '{1}'\", partition, data));\n            }\n        }\n\n    This method uses an **EventHubReceiver** instance to receive messages from all the IoT hub device-to-cloud receive partitions. Notice how you pass a `DateTime.Now` parameter when you create the **EventHubReceiver** object so that it only receives messages sent after it starts.\n\n7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Receive messages\\n\");\n        eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, iotHubD2cEndpoint);\n\n        var d2cPartitions = eventHubClient.GetRuntimeInformation().PartitionIds;\n\n        foreach (string partition in d2cPartitions)\n        {\n           ReceiveMessagesFromDeviceAsync(partition);\n        }  \n        Console.ReadLine();\n\n\n<!-- Links -->\n\n[lnk-eventhubs-tutorial]: event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted.md\n[lnk-devguide-identity]: iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry\n[lnk-servicebus-nuget]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.ServiceBus\n[lnk-event-hubs-overview]: event-hubs-overview.md\n\n[lnk-nuget-device-sdk]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices/\n[lnk-processd2c-tutorial]: iot-hub-csharp-csharp-process-d2c.md\n\n<!-- Images -->\n[10]: ./media/iot-hub-getstarted-cloud-csharp/create-identity-csharp1.png\n[11]: ./media/iot-hub-getstarted-cloud-csharp/create-identity-csharp2.png\n[12]: ./media/iot-hub-getstarted-cloud-csharp/create-identity-csharp3.png\n\n\n"
