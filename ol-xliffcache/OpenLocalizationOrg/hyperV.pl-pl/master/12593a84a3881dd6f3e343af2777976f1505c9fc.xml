They are used just like the network adapter (NIC) on your physical computer.  \n\nFor this example, we are going to create an External switch.  The external switch will allow your virtual machine to access the host machine's network adapter.  If your host machine is connected to the internet, your virtual machine will be as well. \n \nWe'll also set the switch to allow the host to share this network adapter. This makes it so both the virtual machines and the host can use the same network.\n\n<!-- We should have a userguide for setting up a private network/virtual network -->\n\n1. In Hyper-V manager, click **Virtual Switch Manager**.\n\n  ![](media/virtual_switch_manager1.png)\n  \n2. Select **New virtual network switch**.\n\n  ![](media/new_switch.png)\n  \n3. Select **External** and **Create Virtual Switch**.\n\n  ![](media/new_switch_createbutton.png)\n  \n4. Under **Name**, type **External**.\n5. Under **External network**, select the correct network adapter (there will probably only be one option).  \n6. Select **Allow management operating system to share this network adapter** and click **OK**. \n  \n  ![](media/share_nic.png)  \n  \n7.
