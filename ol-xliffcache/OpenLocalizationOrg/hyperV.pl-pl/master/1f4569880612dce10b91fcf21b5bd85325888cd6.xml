For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](active-directory-editions.md).\n\nIf errors occur in accessing a published application or in publishing applications, check the following options to see if Microsoft Azure AD Application Proxy is working correctly:\n\n- Open the Windows Services console and verify that the “Microsoft AAD Application Proxy Connector” service is enabled and running. You may also want to look at the Application Proxy service properties page, as shown in the following image:\n\n![](./media/active-directory-application-proxy-troubleshoot/connectorproperties.png)\n\n- Open Event Viewer and look for events related to the Application Proxy connector located under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **AadApplicationProxy** > **Connector** > **Admin**.\n- If needed, more detailed logs are available by turning on analytics and debugging logs and turning on the Application Proxy connector session log.\n\n\n## General errors\n\nError | Description | Resolution\n--- | --- | ---\nThis corporate app can’t be accessed. You are not authorized to access this application. Authorization failed. Make sure to assign the user with access to this application. | You may not have assigned the user for this application. | Go to the Application tab, and under Users and Groups, assign this user or user group to this application.\nThis corporate app can’t be accessed. You are not authorized to access this application. Authorization failed. Make sure that the user has a license for Azure Active Directory Premium or Basic. | Your user may get this error when trying to access the app you published if the user who tried to access the application was not explicitly assigned with a Premium/Basic license by the subscriber’s administrator. | Go to the subscriber’s Active Directory **Licenses** tab and make sure that this user or user group is assigned a Premium or Basic license.\n\n\n## Connector troubleshooting\nIf registration fails during the Connector wizard installation, you can view the reason for the failure either by looking in the event log under **Windows Logs** > **Application**, or by running the following Windows PowerShell command.\n\n    Get-EventLog application –source “Microsoft AAD Application Proxy Connector” –EntryType “Error” –Newest 1\n\n| Error | Description | Resolution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Connector registration failed: Make sure you enabled Application Proxy in the Azure Management Portal and that you entered your Active Directory user name and password correctly. Error: 'One or more errors occurred.' | You closed the registration window without performing login to Azure AD. | Run the Connector wizard again and register the Connector. |\n| Connector registration failed: Make sure you enabled Application Proxy in the Azure Management Portal and that you entered your Active Directory user name and password correctly. Error: 'AADSTS50001: Resource `https://proxy.cloudwebappproxy.net/registerapp` is disabled.' | Application Proxy is disabled.  | Make sure you enable Application Proxy in the Azure AD portal before trying to register the Connector. For more information on enabling Application Proxy, see [Enable Application Proxy services](active-directory-application-proxy-enable.md). |\n| Connector registration failed: Make sure you enabled Application Proxy in the Azure Management Portal and that you entered your Active Directory user name and password correctly. Error: 'One or more errors occurred.' | If the registration window opens and then immediately closes without allowing you to log in, you will probably get this error. This error occurs when there is some sort of networking error on your system. | Make sure that it is possible to connect from a browser to a public website and that the ports are open as specified in [Application Proxy prerequisites](active-directory-application-proxy-enable.md). |\n| Connector registration failed: Make sure your computer is connected to the Internet. Error: 'There was no endpoint listening at `https://connector.msappproxy.net:9090/register/RegisterConnector` that could accept the message. This is often caused by an incorrect address or SOAP action. See InnerException, if present, for more details.' | If you log in using your Azure AD username and password but then you receive this error, it may be that all ports above 8081 are blocked. | Make sure that the necessary ports are open. For more information see [Application Proxy prerequisites](active-directory-application-proxy-enable.md). |\n| Clear error is presented in the registration window. Cannot proceed – only to close the window | You entered the wrong username or password. | Try again. |\n| Connector registration failed: Make sure you enabled Application Proxy in the Azure Management Portal and that you entered your Active Directory user name and password correctly.

Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell and double click on Turn on Script Execution. This can be set to either Not Configured or Enabled. If set to Enabled, make sure that under Options, the Execution Policy is set to either **Allow local scripts and remote signed scripts** or to **Allow all scripts**. |\n| Connector failed to download the configuration | The Connector’s client certificate, which is used for authentication, expired. This may also occur if you have the Connector installed behind a proxy. In this case the Connector cannot access the Internet and will not be able to provide applications to remote users. | Renew trust manually using the `Register-AppProxyConnector` cmdlet in Windows PowerShell. If your Connector is behind a proxy, it is necessary to grant Internet access to the Connector accounts “network services” and “local system”. This can be accomplished either by granting them access to the Proxy or by setting them to bypass the proxy. |\n| Connector registration failed: Make sure you are a Global Administrator of your Active Directory to register the Connector. Error: 'The registration request was denied.' | The alias you're trying to log in with isn't an admin on this domain. Your Connector is always installed for the directory that owns the user’s domain. | Make sure that the admin you are trying to log in as has global permissions to the Azure AD tenant.|\n\n\n## Kerberos errors\n\n| Error | Description | Resolution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Failed to retrieve the current execution policy for running PowerShell scripts | If the Connector installation fails, check to make sure that PowerShell execution policy is not disabled. | Open the Group Policy Editor. Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows PowerShell and double click on Turn on Script Execution. This can be set to either Not Configured or Enabled.
