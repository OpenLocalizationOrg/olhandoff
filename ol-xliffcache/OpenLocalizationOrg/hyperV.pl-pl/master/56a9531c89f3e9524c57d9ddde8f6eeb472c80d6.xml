The easiest way to configure this is to use PowerShell or Azure CLI.\n\nYou should install [Azure PowerShell 1.0][lnk-powershell-install] or later before you continue.\n\nThe following steps show how to set up password authentication for an AD application using PowerShell. You can run these commands in a standard PowerShell session.\n\n1. Log in to your Azure subscription using the following command:\n\n    ```\n    Login-AzureRmAccount\n    ```\n\n2. Make a note of your **TenantId** and **SubscriptionId**. You will need them later.\n\n3. Create a new Azure Active Directory application using the following command, replacing the place holders:\n\n    - **{Display name}:** a display name for your application such as **MySampleApp**\n    - **{Home page URL}:** the URL of the home page of your app such as **http://mysampleapp/home**. This URL does not need to point to a real application.\n    - **{Application identifier}:** A unique identifier such as **http://mysampleapp**.

Make a note of the **ApplicationId** of the application you created. You will need this later.\n\n5. Create a new service principal using the following command, replacing **{MyApplicationId}** with the **ApplicationId** from the previous step:\n\n    ```\n    New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId {MyApplicationId}\n    ```\n    \n6. Setup a role assignment using the following command, replacing **{MyApplicationId}** with your **ApplicationId**.\n\n    ```\n    New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Owner -ServicePrincipalName {MyApplicationId}\n    ```\n    \nYou have now finished creating the Azure AD application that will enable you to authenticate from your custom C# application.
