Set this property to \"Present\" to ensure the variable exists. Set it to \"Absent\" to ensure the variable does not exist. The default value is \"Present\".| \n| Path| Defines the environment variable that is being configured. Set this property to **$true** if the variable is the **Path** variable; otherwise, set it to **$false**. The default is **$false**. If the variable being configured is the **Path** variable, the value provided through the **Value** property will be appended to the existing value.| \n| DependsOn | Indicates that the configuration of another resource must run before this resource is configured. For example, if the **ID** of the resource configuration script block that you want to run first is **ResourceName** and its type is **ResourceType**, the syntax for using this property is `DependsOn = \"[ResourceType]ResourceName\"`.| \n\n## Additional Information\n\n* If **Path** is absent or set to **$false**, environment variables are managed in `/etc/environment`. Your programs or scripts may require configuration to source the `/etc/environment` file to access the managed environment variables.\n* If **Path** is set to **$true**, the environment variable is managed in the file `/etc/profile.d/DSCenvironment.sh`. This file will be created if it does not exist. If **Ensure** is set to \"Absent\" and **Path** is set to **$true**, an existing environment variable will only be removed from `/etc/profile.d/DSCenvironment.sh` and not from other files.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example shows how to use the **nxEnvironment** resource to ensure that **TestEnvironmentVariable** is present and has the value \"Test-Value\". If **TestEnvironmentVariable** is not present, it will be created.\n\n```\nImport-DSCResource -Module nx \n\n\nnxEnvironment EnvironmentExample\n{\n    Ensure = “Present”\n    Name = “TestEnvironmentVariable”\n    Value = “TestValue”\n}\n```\n\n\n"}
