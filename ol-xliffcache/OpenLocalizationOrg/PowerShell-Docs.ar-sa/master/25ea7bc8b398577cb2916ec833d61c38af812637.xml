Another way to look at this is to consider the structural configuration (for example, a configuration might require that IIS be installed) as separate from the environmental configuration (that is, whether the situation is a test environment vs. a production one—the node names would be different, but the configuration applied to them would be the same). This has the following advantages:\n\n* It allows you to reuse your configuration data for different resources, nodes, and configurations.\n* Configuration logic is more reusable if it does not contain hard-coded data. This is similar to good scripting guidelines for functions.\n* If some of the data needs to change, you can make the changes in one location, thereby saving time and reducing errors.\n\n## Basic concepts and examples\n\nTo specify the environmental part of the configuration, DSC uses the **ConfigurationData** parameter, which is a hash table (or it can take a .psd1 file which contains the hash table). This hash table must have at least one key **AllNodes**, which has a structured value. For example:\n\n```powershell\n$MyData = \n@{\n    AllNodes = @();\n    NonNodeData = \"\"   \n}\n```\n\nNote the AllNodes key, whose value is an array. Each element of this array is also a hash table, which requires NodeName as a key:\n\n```powershell\n$MyData = \n@{\n    AllNodes = \n    @(\n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-1\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-2\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-3\"\n        }\n    );\n\n    NonNodeData = \"\"   \n}\n```\n\nEach hash table entry in AllNodes corresponds to configuration data to a node in the configuration. In addition to the required NodeName key, you can add other keys to the hash table as well, for example:\n\n```powershell\n$MyData = \n@{\n    AllNodes = \n    @(\n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-1\";\n            \n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-2\";\n            Role     = \"SQLServer\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-3\";\n            Role     = \"WebServer\"\n        }\n    );\n\n    NonNodeData = \"\"   \n}\n```\n\nDSC offers three special variables to use in the configuration script:\n\n* **$AllNodes**: Refers to all of the nodes. You can use filtering with **.Where()** and **.ForEach()**, so instead of hard-coding node names to select particular nodes for action, you could write something like this to select VM-1 and VM-3 in the above example:\n\n```powershell\nconfiguration MyConfiguration\n{\n    node $AllNodes.Where{$_.Role -eq \"WebServer\"}.NodeName\n    {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* **$Node**: Once the set of nodes is filtered, you can use $Node to refer to the particular entry. For example:\n\n```powershell\nconfiguration MyConfiguration\n{\n    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xWebAdministration -Name MSFT_xWebsite\n    node $AllNodes.Where{$_.Role -eq \"WebServer\"}.NodeName\n    {\n        xWebsite Site\n        {\n            Name         = $Node.SiteName\n            PhysicalPath = $Node.SiteContents\n            Ensure       = \"Present\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo apply a property to all nodes, you can set NodeName = “*”. For example, to give every node the LogPath property, you could do this:\n\n```\n$MyData = \n@{\n    AllNodes = \n    @(\n        @{\n            NodeName           = \"*\"\n            LogPath            = \"C:\\Logs\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-1\";\n            Role     = \"WebServer\"\n            SiteContents = \"C:\\Site1\"\n            SiteName = \"Website1\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-2\";\n            Role     = \"SQLServer\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-3\";\n            Role     = \"WebServer\";\n            SiteContents = \"C:\\Site2\"\n            SiteName = \"Website3\"\n        }\n    );\n}\n```\n\n* **$ConfigurationData**: You can use this variable inside a configuration to access the configuration data hash table passed as a parameter. For example:\n\n```powershell\n$MyData = \n@{\n    AllNodes = \n    @(\n        @{\n            NodeName           = \"*\"\n            LogPath            = \"C:\\Logs\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-1\";\n            Role     = \"WebServer\"\n            SiteContents = \"C:\\Site1\"\n            SiteName = \"Website1\"\n        },\n\n \n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-2\";\n            Role     = \"SQLServer\"\n        },\n \n\n        @{\n            NodeName = \"VM-3\";\n            Role     = \"WebServer\";\n            SiteContents = \"C:\\Site2\"\n            SiteName = \"Website3\"\n        }\n    );\n\n    NonNodeData = \n    @{\n        ConfigFileContents = (Get-Content C:\\Template\\Config.xml)\n     }   \n} \n\nconfiguration MyConfiguration\n{\n    Import-DscResource -ModuleName xWebAdministration -Name MSFT_xWebsite\n\n    node $AllNodes.Where{$_.Role -eq \"WebServer\"}.NodeName\n    {\n        xWebsite Site\n        {\n            Name         = $Node.SiteName\n            PhysicalPath = $Node.SiteContents\n            Ensure       = \"Present\"\n        }\n\n        File ConfigFile\n        {\n            DestinationPath = $Node.SiteContents + \"\\\\config.xml\"\n            Contents = $ConfigurationData.NonNodeData.ConfigFileContents\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can find a full example included in the [xWebAdministration module](https://powershellgallery.com/packages/xWebAdministration)."}
