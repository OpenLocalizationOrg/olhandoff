This makes the libraries globally available in Hive (no need to use [ADD JAR](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli) to load them.)\n\n##How it works\n\nWhen creating a cluster, you can optionally specify a Script Action that runs a script on the cluster nodes while they are being created. The script in this document accepts a single parameter, which is a WASB location that contains the libraries (stored as jar files,) that will be pre-loaded.\n\nDuring cluster creation, the script enumerates the files, copies them to the `/usr/lib/customhivelibs/` directory on head and worker nodes, then adds them to the `hive.aux.jars.path` property in the `core-site.xml` file. On Linux-based clusters, it also updates the `hive-env.sh` file with the location of the files.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] Using the script actions in this article makes the libraries available in the following scenarios:\n>\n> * __Linux-based HDInsight__ - when using the __Hive command-line__, __WebHCat__ (Templeton,) and __HiveServer2__.\n> * __Windows-based HDInsight__ - when using the __Hive command-line__ and __WebHCat__ (Templeton).\n\n##The script\n\n__Script location__\n\nFor __Linux-based clusters__: [https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxsetupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.sh](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxsetupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.sh)\n\nFor __Windows-based clusters__: [https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/setupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.ps1](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/setupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.ps1)\n\n__Requirements__\n\n* The scripts must be applied to both the __Head nodes__ and __Worker nodes__.\n\n* The jars you wish to install must be stored in Azure Blob Storage in a __single container__. \n\n* The storage account containing the library of jar files __must__ be linked to the HDInsight cluster during creation. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:\n\n    * By being in a container on the default storage account for the cluster.\n    \n    * By being in a container on an linked storage container. For example, in the portal you can use __Optional Configuration__, __Linked storage accounts__ to add additional storage.\n\n* The WASB path to the container must be specified as a parameter to the Script Action. For example, if the jars are stored in a container named __libs__ on a storage account named __mystorage__, the parameter would be __wasb://libs@mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/__.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] This document assumes that you have already create a storage account, blob container, and uploaded the files to it. \n    >\n    > If you have not created a storage account, you can do this through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You can then use a utility such as [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) to create a new container in the account and upload files to it.\n\n##Create a cluster using the script\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The following steps create a new Linux-based HDInsight cluster. To create a new Windows-based cluster, select __Windows__ as the cluster OS when creating the cluster, and use the Windows (PowerShell) script instead of the bash script.\n> \n> You can also use Azure PowerShell or the HDInsight .NET SDK to create a cluster using this script. For more information on using these methods, see [Customize HDInsight clusters with Script Actions](hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md).\n\n1. Start provisioning a cluster by using the steps in [Provision HDInsight clusters on Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#portal), but do not complete provisioning.\n\n2. On the **Optional Configuration** blade, select **Script Actions**, and provide the information as shown below:\n\n    * __NAME__: Enter a friendly name for the script action.\n    * __SCRIPT URI__: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxsetupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.sh\n    * __HEAD__: Check this option\n    * __WORKER__: Check this option.\n    * __ZOOKEEPER__: Leave this blank.\n    * __PARAMETERS__: Enter the WASB address to the container and storage account that contains the jars. For example, __wasb://libs@mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/__.\n\n3. At the bottom of the **Script Actions**, use the **Select** button to save the configuration.\n\n4. On the **Optional Configuration** blade, select __Linked Storage Accounts__ and select the __Add a storage key__ link. Select the storage account that contains the jars, and then use the __select__ buttons to save settings and return the __Optional Configuration__ blade.\n\n5. Use the **Select** button at the bottom of the **Optional Configuration** blade to save the optional configuration information.\n\n6. Continue provisioning the cluster as described in [Provision HDInsight clusters on Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#portal).\n\nOnce cluster creation finishes, you will be able to use the jars added through this script from Hive without having to use the `ADD JAR` statement.\n\n##Next steps\n\nIn this document you have learned how to add Hive libraries contained in jar files to a HDInsight cluster during cluster creation.
