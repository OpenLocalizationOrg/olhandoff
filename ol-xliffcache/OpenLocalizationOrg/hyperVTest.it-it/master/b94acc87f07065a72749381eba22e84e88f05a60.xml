Launch Azure Storage Explorer \n2.  If the storage account you want to access has not been added to Azure Storage Explorer, click the \"Add Account\" button to add the account. If it has already been added, select the account from the \"--Select a Storage Account--\" dropdown.  \n![Create workspace][1]\n<br>\n3.
