Install Git on your local computer.\n\n    The steps required to install Git vary between operating systems. See [Installing Git] for operating system specific distributions and installation guidance.\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE]\n    > On some operating systems, both a command-line and GUI version of Git are available. The instructions provided in this article use the command-line version.\n\n2. Open a command-line, such as **GitBash** (Windows) or **Bash** (Unix Shell). On OS X systems you can access the command-line through the **Terminal** application.\n\n3. From the command line, change to the directory where you will store your scripts. For example, `cd SourceControl`.\n\n4. Use the following command to create a local copy of your new Git repository, replacing `<your_git_URL>` with the URL of the Git repository for your mobile service:\n\n        git clone <your_git_URL>\n\n5. When prompted, type in the user name and password that you set when you enabled source control in your mobile service.

Browse to the directory from which you ran the `git clone` command, and notice that a new directory is created with the name of the mobile service. For a .NET backend mobile service, the git repository is initial empty.\n\nNow that you have created your local repository, you can publish your .NET backend service project from this repository.\n\n##<a name=\"deploy-scripts\"></a>Publish your project by using Git\n\n1.

Remove any NuGet package folders, leaving the packages.config file.\n\n    Mobile Services will automatically restore your NuGet packages based on the packages.confign file. You can also define a .gitignore file to prevent the package directories from being added.\n\n3. In the Git command prompt, type the following command to start tracking the new script file:\n\n        $ git add .\n\n4. Type the following command to commit changes:\n\n        $ git commit -m \"adding the .NET backend service project\"\n\n5. Type the following command to upload the changes to the remote repository, and supply your credentials:\n\n        $ git push origin master\n\n    You should see a series of commands that indicates that the project is deployed to Mobile Services, packages are added, and the service is restarted.\n\n6.
