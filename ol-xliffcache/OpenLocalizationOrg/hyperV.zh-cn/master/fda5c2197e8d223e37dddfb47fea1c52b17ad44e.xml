However, virtual machines that are migrated from on-premises datacenters would not have the VM Agent installed. For such VMs, the VM Agent needs to be installed explicitly. Read more about [installing the VM agent on an existing VM](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/04/08/install-the-vm-agent-on-an-existing-azure-vm.aspx).\n\nFor Windows VMs:\n\n- Download and install the [agent MSI](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409). You will need Administrator privileges to complete the installation.\n- [Update the VM property](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/04/08/install-the-vm-agent-on-an-existing-azure-vm.aspx) to indicate that the agent is installed.\n\nFor Linux VMs:\n\n- Install latest [Linux agent](https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent) from github.\n- [Update the VM property](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/04/08/install-the-vm-agent-on-an-existing-azure-vm.aspx) to indicate that the agent is installed.\n\n\n### Updating the VM Agent\nFor Windows VMs:\n\n- Updating the VM Agent is as simple as reinstalling the [VM Agent binaries](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409). However, you need to ensure that no backup operation is running while the VM Agent is being updated.\n\nFor Linux VMs:\n\n- Follow the instructions on [Updating Linux VM Agent ](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-update-agent.md).\n\n\n### Validating VM Agent installation\nHow to check for the VM Agent version on Windows VMs:\n\n1. Log on to the Azure virtual machine and navigate to the folder *C:\\WindowsAzure\\Packages*. You should find the WaAppAgent.exe file present.\n2. Right-click the file, go to **Properties**, and then select the **Details** tab. The Product Version field should be 2.6.1198.718 or higher\n\n## Troubleshoot VM Snapshot Issues\nVM backup relies on issuing snapshot command to underlying storage. Not having access to storage or delay in snapshot task execution can fail the backup. The following can cause snapshot task failure.\n\n1. Network access to Storage is blocked using NSG<br>\n    Learn more on how to [enable network access](backup-azure-vms-prepare.md#2-network-connectivity) to Storage using either WhiteListing of IPs or through proxy server.\n2.  VMs with Sql Server backup configured can cause snapshot task delay <br>\n    By default VM backup issues VSS Full backup on Windows VMs. On VMs which are running Sql Servers and Sql Server backup is configured, this might cause delay in snapshot execution. Please set following registry key if you are experiencing backup failures because of snapshot issues.\n\n    ```\n    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\BCDRAGENT]\n    \"USEVSSCOPYBACKUP\"=\"TRUE\"\n    ```\n3.  VM status reported incorrectly because VM is shutdown in RDP.  <br>\n    If you have Shut down the virtual machine in RDP, please check back in the portal that VM status is reflected correctly. If not, please shutdown the VM in portal using 'Shutdown' option in VM dashboard.\n4.  Many VMs from same cloud service are configured to backup at the same time.<br>\n    It is best practice to spread the VMs from same cloud service to have different backup schedules.\n5.  VM is running at High CPU/Memory.<br>\n    If the virtual machine is running at High CPU usage(>90%) or memory, snapshot task is queued, delayed and wil eventually gets timed-out. Try on-demand backup in such situations.\n\n<br>\n\n## Networking\nLike all extensions, Backup extension need access to the public internet to work. Not having access to the public internet can manifest itself in a variety of ways:\n\n- The extension installation can fail\n- The backup operations (like disk snapshot) can fail\n- Displaying the status of the backup operation can fail\n\nThe need for resolving public internet addresses has been articulated [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mast/archive/2014/06/18/azure-vm-provisioning-stuck-on-quot-installing-extensions-on-virtual-machine-quot.aspx). You will need to check the DNS configurations for the VNET and ensure that the Azure URIs can be resolved.\n\nOnce the name resolution is done correctly, access to the Azure IPs also needs to be provided. To unblock access to the Azure infrastructure, follow one of these steps:\n\n1. WhiteList the Azure datacenter IP ranges.\n    - Get the list of [Azure datacenter IPs](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) to be whitelisted.\n    - Unblock the IPs using the [New-NetRoute](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh826148.aspx) cmdlet. Run this cmdlet within the Azure VM, in an elevated PowerShell window (run as Administrator).\n    - Add rules to the NSG (if you have one in place) to allow access to the IPs.\n2. Create a path for HTTP traffic to flow\n    - If you have some network restriction in place (a Network Security Group, for example) deploy an HTTP proxy server to route the traffic. Steps to deploy a HTTP Proxy server can found [here](backup-azure-vms-prepare.md#2-network-connectivity).\n    - Add rules to the NSG (if you have one in place) to allow access to the INTERNET from the HTTP Proxy.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] DHCP must be enabled inside the guest for IaaS VM Backup to work.  If you need a static private IP, you should configure it through the platform. The DHCP option inside the VM should be left enabled.\nView more information about [Setting a Static Internal Private IP](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-reserved-private-ip.md).\n"
