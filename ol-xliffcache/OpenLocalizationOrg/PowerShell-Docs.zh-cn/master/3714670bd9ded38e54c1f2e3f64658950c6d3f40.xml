To do this, you have to configure the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) with the necessary information. To configure the LCM, you create a special type of configuration known as a \"metaconfiguration\". For more information about configuring the LCM, see [Windows PowerShell 4.0 Desired State Configuration Local Configuration Manager](metaConfig4.md)\n\nThe following script configures the LCM to pull configurations from a server named \"PullServer\".\n\n```powershell\nConfiguration SimpleMetaConfigurationForPull \n{ \n    LocalConfigurationManager \n    { \n        ConfigurationID = \"1C707B86-EF8E-4C29-B7C1-34DA2190AE24\";\n        RefreshMode = \"PULL\";\n        DownloadManagerName = \"WebDownloadManager\";\n        RebootNodeIfNeeded = $true;\n        RefreshFrequencyMins = 15;\n        ConfigurationModeFrequencyMins = 30; \n        ConfigurationMode = \"ApplyAndAutoCorrect\";\n        DownloadManagerCustomData = @{ServerUrl = \"http://PullServer:8080/PSDSCPullServer/PSDSCPullServer.svc\"; AllowUnsecureConnection = “TRUE”}\n    } \n} \nSimpleMetaConfigurationForPull -Output \".\"\n```\n\nIn the script, **DownloadManagerCustomData** passes the URL of the pull server and (for this example) allows an unsecured connection. \n\nAfter this script runs, it creates a new output folder called **SimpleMetaConfigurationForPull** and puts a metaconfiguration MOF file there.\n\nTo apply the configuration, use **Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager** with parameters for **ComputerName** (use “localhost”) and **Path** (the path to the location of the target node’s localhost.meta.mof file). For example: \n```powershell\nSet-DSCLocalConfigurationManager –ComputerName localhost –Path . –Verbose.\n```\n\n## Configuration ID\nThe script sets the **ConfigurationID** property of the LCM to a GUID that had been previously created for this purpose (you can create a GUID by using the **New-Guid** cmdlet). The **ConfigurationID** is what the LCM uses to find the appropriate configuration on the pull server. The configuration MOF file on the pull server must be named `ConfigurationID.mof`, where *ConfigurationID* is the value of the **ConfigurationID** property of the target node's LCM.\n"}
