To view this report, select one of your apps in the dashboard and click **Analytics** &gt; **Advertising performance** in the navigation pane.\n\nThe data is obtained from the following seven performance metrics we track for the ads in your app:\n\n-   **Estimated revenue**: The estimated amount of money you received from the ads running on your app.\n-   **eCPM**: Effective cost per thousand impressions.\n-   **Requests**: The number of times an ad request was sent to the Microsoft Ad Network from your app.\n-   **Impressions**: The number of times an ad was shown in your app.\n-   **Fill rate**: The percentage of ad requests sent from your app in which an ad was shown.\n-   **Clicks**: The number of times someone clicked on an ad in your app.\n-   **CTR**: Click-through rate, meaning the number of times an ad was clicked, divided by the number of impressions.\n\nTo review all these performance metrics for the ad units in your app, refer to the table below the graph and map views.\n\nTo analyze the data for one of these metrics in a graph or world map view, click **Graph** or **Map**.

In this report, these ad units are associated with app names that you specified in pubCenter, with the string **(pubCenter)** appended to the app name.\n\nIf you created ad units for an app using pubCenter, and you don’t see data for them in either report page, click **Link a pubCenter account** to link that account to your Dev Center account. Enter the email address you associated with this pubCenter account and your account linking code. You can find the account linking code by signing into this pubCenter account and going to the **My information** page.\n\nFor more information about migrating pubCenter accounts to Dev Center, see [pubCenter-DevCenter integration](pubcenter-dev-center-integration.md).\n\n## Advertising performance summary\n\n\nThe **Advertising performance** section on your **Dashboard overview** page provides data that is similar to the account-level advertising performance report, with the following differences:\n\n-   It provides the data only in graph form.
