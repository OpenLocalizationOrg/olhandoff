Code your credentials into your scripts.  **Don't do this for any real workload or system**\n > Warning:  _Do not do this in a production system.  Do not do this with real passwords._\n  \n  You can hand craft a PSCredential object with some code like this:  \n  ``` PowerShell\n  $localCred = New-Object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist \"Administrator\", (ConvertTo-SecureString \"P@ssw0rd\" -AsPlainText -Force) \n  ```\n  Grossly insecure - but useful for testing.
