If you subscribe to any of Microsoft Online business services (e.g. Office 365, Microsoft Azure, etc), you get Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with access to all of the Free features, described below.  \n\nAzure Active Directory is a service that provides comprehensive identity and access management capabilities in the cloud for your employees, partners and customers. It combines directory services, advanced identity governance, a rich standards-based platform for developers, and application access management for your own or any of thousands of pre-integrated applications. With the Azure Active Directory Free edition, you can manage users and groups, synchronize with on-premises directories, get single sign-on across Azure, Office 365, and thousands of popular SaaS applications like Salesforce, Workday, Concur, DocuSign, Google Apps, Box, ServiceNow, Dropbox, and more. To learn more about Azure Active Directory, read [What is Azure AD](active-directory-whatis.md).\n\n\nTo enhance your Azure Active Directory, you can add paid capabilities using the Azure Active Directory Basic and Premium editions. Azure Active Directory paid editions are built on top of your existing free directory, providing enterprise class capabilities spanning self-service, enhanced monitoring, security reporting, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and secure access for your mobile workforce.\n\nOffice 365 subscriptions include additional Azure Active Directory features described in the comparison table below. \n\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] For the pricing options of these editions, see [Azure Active Directory Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/). <br>Azure Active Directory Premium and Azure Active Directory Basic are not currently supported in China. Please contact us at the Azure Active Directory Forum for more information\n\n\n- **Azure Active Directory Basic** - Designed for task workers with cloud-first needs, this edition provides cloud centric application access and self-service identity management solutions. With the Basic edition of Azure Active Directory, you get productivity enhancing and cost reducing features like group-based access management, self-service password reset for cloud applications, and Azure Active Directory Application Proxy (to publish on-premises web applications using Azure Active Directory), all backed by an enterprise-level SLA of 99.9 percent uptime.\n \n- **Azure Active Directory Premium** - Designed to empower organizations with more demanding identity and access management needs, Azure Active Directory Premium edition adds feature-rich enterprise-level identity management capabilities and enables hybrid users to seamlessly access on-premises and cloud capabilities. This edition includes everything you need for information worker and identity administrators in hybrid environments across application access, self-service identity and access management (IAM), identity protection and security in the cloud. It supports advanced administration and delegation resources like dynamic groups and self-service group management. It includes Microsoft Identity Manager (an on-premises identity and access management suite) and provides cloud write-back capabilities enabling solutions like self-service password reset for your on-premises users. \n\nTo sign up and start using Active Directory Premium today, see [Getting started with Azure Active Directory Premium](active-directory-get-started-premium.md).\n\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] \n>A number of Azure Active Directory capabilities are available through \"pay as you go\" editions:\n>\n>- Active Directory B2C is the identity and access management solution for your consumer-facing applications.
