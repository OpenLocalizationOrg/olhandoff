You will see a placeholder definition that you can fill in with your application's logic.\n\nIt's recommended to use **parameters** throughout your definition. This will be useful if you want to deploy to both a development and production environment. In that case, you should put all environment-specific configuration in the `.param` file, and the parameters instead of the actual strings.\n\nToday, Visual Studio does not have a built-in JSON designer, so if you'd like to use a graphical interface (as opposed to writing JSON), you will need to use the Azure Portal. \n\nIf you previously created a Logic app inside the Azure Portal and now want to check it in to source control, there are three ways to accomplish this:\n- Go to **Code view** in the portal and copy the definition.\n- Use the Logic apps [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn948510.aspx) to get the definition.\n- Use [Azure Resource manager powershell](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md),  specifically the [`Get-AzureResource` command](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn654579.aspx) to download the definition.\n\n## Deploying your Logic app\n\nFinally, after you have configured your app you can deploy directly from Visual Studio in just a couple steps. \n\n1. Right-click on the deployment in the Solution Explorer and go to **Deploy** > **New deployment...**\n    ![New deployment](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/newdeployment.png)\n\n2. You will be prompted to sign in to your Azure subscription(s). \n\n3. Now you need to choose the details of the resource group that you want to deploy the Logic app to. \n    ![Deploy to resource group](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/deploytoresourcegroup.png)\n\n    Be sure to select the right template and parameters files for the resource group (for example if you are deploying to a production environment you'll want to choose the production parameters file). \n    \n4. The status of the deployment will appear in the **Output** window (you may need to choose **Azure Provisioning**. \n    ![Output](./media/app-service-logic-deploy-from-vs/output.png)\n\nIn the future you can revise your Logic app in source control and use Visual Studio to deploy new versions. Note that if you modify the definition in the Azure Portal directly, the next time you deploy from Visual Studio those changes will be overwritten.\n\nIf you do not want to use Visual Studio, but still want to use tooling to deploy your Logic app from source control, you can use the [API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn948510.aspx) or [Powershell](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md) directly to automate your deployments.  \n\n"
