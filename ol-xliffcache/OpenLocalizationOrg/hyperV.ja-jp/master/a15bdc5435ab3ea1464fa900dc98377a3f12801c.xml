Register an app\n2. Sign the user into the web app using OpenID Connect\n3. Use ADAL to get an access token upon user sign-in\n4. Call the To-Do List Web API with an access token.\n\nThe code for this tutorial is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIdConnect-DotNet).  \n\nTo follow along, you can [download the app's skeleton as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/skeleton.zip) or clone the skeleton:\n\n```git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIdConnect-DotNet.git```\n\nAlternatively, you can [download the completed app as a .zip](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip) or clone the completed app:\n\n```git clone --branch complete https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIdConnect-DotNet.git```\n\n## 1. Register an App\nCreate a new app at [apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com), or follow these [detailed steps](active-directory-v2-app-registration.md).  Make sure to:\n\n- Copy down the **Application Id** assigned to your app, you'll need it soon.\n- Create an **App Secret** of the **Password** type, and copy down its value for later\n- Add the **Web** platform for your app.\n- Enter the correct **Redirect URI**. The redirect uri indicates to Azure AD where authentication responses should be directed - the default for this tutorial is `https://localhost:44326/`.\n\n\n## 2. Sign the user in with OpenID Connect\nHere, we'll configure the OWIN middleware to use the [OpenID Connect authentication protocol](active-directory-v2-protocols.md#openid-connect-sign-in-flow).  OWIN will be used to issue sign-in and sign-out requests, manage the user's session, and get information about the user, amongst other things.\n\n-   To begin, open the `web.config` file in the root of the `TodoList-WebApp` project, and enter your app's configuration values in the `<appSettings>` section.\n    -   The `ida:ClientId` is the **Application Id** assigned to your app in the registration portal.\n    - The `ida:ClientSecret` is the **App Secret** you created in the registration portal.\n    -   The `ida:RedirectUri` is the **Redirect Uri** you entered in the portal.\n- Open the `web.config` file in the root of the `TodoList-Service` project, and replace the `ida:Audience` with the same **Application Id** as above.\n\n\n-   Now add the OWIN middleware NuGet packages to the `TodoList-WebApp` project using the Package Manager Console.\n\n```\nPM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect -ProjectName TodoList-WebApp\nPM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies -ProjectName TodoList-WebApp\nPM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb -ProjectName TodoList-WebApp\n```\n\n-   Open the file `App_Start\\Startup.Auth.cs` and add `using` statements for the above libraries.\n- In the same file, implement the `ConfigureAuth(...)` method.  The parameters you provide in `OpenIDConnectAuthenticationOptions` will serve as coordinates for your app to communicate with Azure AD.\n\n```C#\npublic void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)\n{\n    app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);\n\n    app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());\n\n    app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(\n        new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions\n        {\n\n                    // The `Authority` represents the v2.0 endpoint - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0\n                    // The `Scope` describes the permissions that your app will need.  See https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-scopes/\n                    // In a real application you could use issuer validation for additional checks, like making sure the user's organization has signed up for your app, for instance.\n\n                    ClientId = clientId,\n                    Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, \"common\", \"/v2.0\"),\n                    Scope = \"openid offline_access\",\n                    RedirectUri = redirectUri,\n                    PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,\n                    TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters\n                    {\n                        ValidateIssuer = false,\n                    },\n\n                    // The `AuthorizationCodeReceived` notification is used to capture and redeem the authorization_code that the v2.0 endpoint returns to your app.\n\n                    Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications\n                    {\n                        AuthenticationFailed = OnAuthenticationFailed,\n                        AuthorizationCodeReceived = OnAuthorizationCodeReceived,\n                    }\n\n        });\n}\n...\n```\n\n## 3. Use ADAL to get an access token upon user sign-in\nIn the `AuthorizationCodeReceived` notification, we want to use [OAuth 2.0 in tandem with OpenID Connect](active-directory-v2-protocols.md#openid-connect-with-oauth-code-flow) to redeem the authorization_code for an access token to the To-Do List Service.  ADAL can make this process easy for you:\n\n- First, install the preview version of ADAL:\n\n```PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Experimental.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName TodoList-WebApp -IncludePrerelease```\n- And add another `using` statement to the `App_Start\\Startup.Auth.cs` file for ADAL.\n- Now add a new method, the `OnAuthorizationCodeReceived` event handler.  This handler will use ADAL to acquire an access token to the To-Do List API, and will store the token in ADAL's token cache for later:\n\n```C#\nprivate async Task OnAuthorizationCodeReceived(AuthorizationCodeReceivedNotification notification)\n{\n        string userObjectId = notification.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst(\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier\").Value;\n        string tenantID = notification.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst(\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid\").Value;\n        string authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, tenantID, string.Empty);\n        ClientCredential cred = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);\n\n        // Here you ask for a token using the web app's clientId as the scope, since the web app and service share the same clientId.\n        var authContext = new Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectId));\n        var authResult = await authContext.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodeAsync(notification.Code, new Uri(redirectUri), cred, new string[] { clientId });\n}\n...\n```\n\n- In web apps, ADAL has an extensible token cache that can be used to store tokens.  This sample implements the `NaiveSessionCache` which uses http session storage to cache tokens.\n\n<!-- TODO: Token Cache article -->\n\n\n## 4. Call the To-Do List Web API\nNow it's time to actually use the access_token you acquired in step 3.  Open the web app's `Controllers\\TodoListController.cs` file, which makes all the CRUD requests to the To-Do List API.\n\n- You can use ADAL again here to fetch access_tokens from the ADAL cache.  First, add a `using` statement for ADAL to this file.\n\n    `using Microsoft.Experimental.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;`\n\n- In the `Index` action, use ADAL's `AcquireTokenSilentAsync` method to get an access_token that can be used to read data from the To-Do List service:\n\n```C#\n...\nstring userObjectID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier\").Value;\nstring tenantID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid\").Value;\nstring authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, Startup.aadInstance, tenantID, string.Empty);\nClientCredential credential = new ClientCredential(Startup.clientId, Startup.clientSecret);\n\n// Here you ask for a token using the web app's clientId as the scope, since the web app and service share the same clientId.\nAuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority, new NaiveSessionCache(userObjectID));\nresult = await authContext.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(new string[] { Startup.clientId }, credential, UserIdentifier.AnyUser);\n...\n```\n\n- The sample then adds the resulting token to the HTTP GET request as the `Authorization` header, which the To-Do List service uses to authenticate the request.\n- If the To-Do List service returns a `401 Unauthorized` response, the access_tokens in ADAL have become invalid for some reason.  In this case, you should drop any access_tokens from the ADAL cache and show the user a message that they may need to sign in again, which will restart the token acquisition flow.\n\n```C#\n...\n// If the call failed with access denied, then drop the current access token from the cache,\n// and show the user an error indicating they might need to sign-in again.\nif (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.Unauthorized)\n{\n        var todoTokens = authContext.TokenCache.ReadItems().Where(a => a.Scope.Contains(Startup.clientId));\n        foreach (TokenCacheItem tci in todoTokens)\n                authContext.TokenCache.DeleteItem(tci);\n\n        return new RedirectResult(\"/Error?message=Error: \" + response.ReasonPhrase + \" You might need to sign in again.\");\n}\n...\n```\n\n- Similarly, if ADAL is unable to return an access_token for any reason, you should instruct the user to sign in again.  This is as simple as catching any `AdalException`:\n\n```C#\n...\ncatch (AdalException ee)\n{\n        // If ADAL could not get a token silently, show the user an error indicating they might need to sign in again.\n        return new RedirectResult(\"/Error?message=An Error Occurred Reading To Do List: \" + ee.Message + \" You might need to log out and log back in.\");\n}\n...\n```\n\n- The exact same `AcquireTokenSilentAsync` call is implementd in the `Create` and `Delete` actions.  In web apps, you can use this ADAL method to get access_tokens whenever you need them in your app.  ADAL will take care of acquiring, caching, and refreshing tokens for you.\n\nFinally, build and run your app!  Sign in with either a Microsoft Account or an Azure AD Account, and notice how the user's identity is reflected in the top navigation bar.  Add and delete some items from the user's To-Do List to see the OAuth 2.0 secured API calls in action.  You now have a web app & web API, both secured using industry standard protocols, that can authenticate users with both their personal and work/school accounts.\n\nFor reference, the completed sample (without your configuration values) [is provided here](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip).  \n\n## Next Steps\n\nFor additional resources, check out:\n- [The App Model v2.0 Preview >>](active-directory-appmodel-v2-overview.md)\n- [StackOverflow \"adal\" tag >>](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/adal)\n\n\n"
