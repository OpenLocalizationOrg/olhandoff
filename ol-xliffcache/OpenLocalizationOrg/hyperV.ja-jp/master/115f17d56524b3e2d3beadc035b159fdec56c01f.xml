To secure your container system more strongly than the default configuration, [Docker recommends](https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/) using addition group-policy or [role-based security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) as well, such as [SELinux](http://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) or [AppArmor](http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page), for example, as well as reducing as much as possible the kernel capabilities that the containers are granted.

For example, several of the [Linux VM Agent extension](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md) features allow you to modify and manage the Virtual Machine, including security features, kernel and networking features, and so on.
