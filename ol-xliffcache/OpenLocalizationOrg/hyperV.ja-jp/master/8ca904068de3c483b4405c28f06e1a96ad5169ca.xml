First, you will need to create an asymmetric key inside your key vault and a symmetric key within SQL Server on your VM. Then, you will be able to execute T-SQL statements to enable encryption for your databases and backups.\n\nThere are several forms of encryption you can take advantage of:\n\n- [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb934049.aspx)\n- [Encrypted backups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn449489.aspx)\n- [Column Level Encryption (CLE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173744.aspx)\n\nThe following Transact-SQL scripts provide examples for each of these areas.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Each example is based on the two prerequisites: an asymmetric key from your key vault called **CONTOSO_KEY** and a credential created by the AKV Integration feature called **Azure_EKM_TDE_cred**.\n\n### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)\n1.
