The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following items:\n    \n* A valid Microsoft Azure subscription\n* An Evidence.com subscription with single sign On enabled (email earlyaccess@evidence.com if SAML-based single sign on is not enabled)\n\nAfter completing this tutorial, the AAD users to whom you have assigned Evidence.com access will be able to single sign into the application using the AAD Access Panel.\n\n## Add Evidence.com to your directory\n\nThis section outlines how to add Evidence.com as an integrated application in Azure Active Directory.\n\n**To enable the application integration for Evidence:**\n\n1.  In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com), on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**.\n\n2.  From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.\n\n3.  To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.\n\n4.  To open the Application Gallery, click **Add**, and then click **Add an application from the gallery**.\n\n5.  In the search box, type **Evidence.com**.\n\n6.

Click the **Download Certificate** link, and save it to your local drive. This certificate and the metadata URLs (  Entity ID, SSO Sign In URL and Sign Out URL ) will be used to set up SSO on Evidence.com site. \n\n5.  In a separate web browser window, login to your Evidence.com tenant as an administrator and navigate to **Admin** Tab\n      \n6.  Click on **Agency Single Sign On**\n \n7.  Select **SAML Based Single Sign On**\n \n8.  Copy the **Issuer URL**, **Single Sign On** and **Single Sign Out** values shown in the Azure classic portal and to the corresponding fields in Evidence.com.\n\n9.

The **Email Address** of the added user must match the username of the users in Azure AD who you wish to give access. If the username and email address are not the same value in your organization, you can use the **Evidence.com > Attributes > Single Sign-On** section of the Azure classic portal to change the nameidenitifer sent to Evidence.com to be the email address.\n\n\n## Assigning users to Evidence.com\n\nFor provisioned AAD users to be able to see Evidence.com on their Access Panel, they must be assigned access inside the Azure classic portal.\n\n**To assign users to Evidence.com:**\n\n1.
