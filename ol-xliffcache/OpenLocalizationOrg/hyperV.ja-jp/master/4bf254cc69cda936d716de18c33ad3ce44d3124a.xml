This feature is designed to protect you from accidental configuration changes and changes to your on-premises directory which would effect a large number of users.\n\nThe default value of 500 objects can be changed with PowerShell using `Enable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold`. You should configure this value to fit your organization’s size. Since the sync scheduler will run every 3 hours, the value is the number of deletes seen within 3 hours.\n\nWith this feature enabled, if there are too many deletes staged to be exported to Azure AD, the export will not continue and you will receive an email like this:\n\n![Hello. At time the Identity synchronization service detected that the number of deletions exceeded the configured threshold for fabrikam.com. A total of 1234 objects were sent for deletion in this Identity synchronization run. This met or exceeded the configured deletion threshold value of 500 objects. We need you to provide confirmation that these deletions should be processed before we will proceed. Please see the preventing accidental deletions for more information about the error listed in this email message.](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-prevent-accidental-deletes/email.png)\n\nIf this was unexpected, then investigate and take corrective actions. To see which objects are about to be deleted, do the following:\n\n1. Start **Synchronization Service** from the Start Menu.\n2. Go to **Connectors**.\n3. Select the Connector with type **Azure Active Directory**.\n4. Under **Actions** to the right, select **Search Connector Space**.\n5. In the pop-up under **Scope** select **Disconnected Since** and pick a time in the past. Click on **Search**. This will provide a view of all objects about to be deleted. By clicking on each item, you can get additional information about the object. You can also click on **Column Setting** to add additional attributes to be visible in the grid.\n\n![Search Connector Space](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-prevent-accidental-deletes/searchcs.png)\n\nIf all the deletes are desired, then do the following:\n\n1. To temporarily disable this protection and let these deletes go through, run the PowerShell cmdlet: `Disable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold`. When asked for credentials, provide an Azure AD Global Administrator account and password.\n![Credentials](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-prevent-accidental-deletes/credentials.png)\n2. With the Azure Active Directory Connector still selected, select the action **Run** and select **Export**.\n3. To re-enable the protection run the PowerShell cmdlet: `Enable-ADSyncExportDeletionThreshold`.\n\n## Next steps\nLearn more about the [Azure AD Connect sync](active-directory-aadconnectsync-whatis.md) configuration.\n\nLearn more about [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-aadconnect.md).\n\n\n"
