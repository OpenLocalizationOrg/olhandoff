On the https://www.azureiotsuite.com/ page, click **+** to create a new solution.\n\n2. Click **Select** on the **Remote monitoring** panel to create your new solution.\n\n3. On the **Create \"Remote monitoring\" solution** page, enter a **Solution name** of your choice, select the **Region** you want to deploy to, and select the Azure subscription to want to use.
