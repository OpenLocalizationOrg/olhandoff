In the **Azure Management Portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. \n<br><br>![Active Directory][1]<br>\n\n2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.\n\n3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.\n<br><br>![Applications][2]<br>\n\n4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.\n<br><br>![Applications][3]<br>\n\n5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.\n<br><br>![Applications][4]<br>\n\n6. In the search box, type **Facebook at Work**.\n\n7. In the results pane, select **Facebook at Work**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.\n\n\n### Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On\n\nThis section outlines how to enable users to authenticate to Facebook at Work with their account in Azure Active Directory, using federation based on the SAML protocol.\n\n**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Facebook at Work, perform the following steps:**\n\n1.  After adding Facebook at Work in the Azure management portal, click **Configure Single Sign-On**.\n\n2.  In the **Configure App URL** screen, enter the URL where users will sign into your Facebook at Work application. This is your Facebook at Work tenant URL \n(Example: https://example.facebook.com/). Once finished, click **Next**.\n\n3.  In a different web browser window, log into your Facebook at Work company site as an administrator.\n\n4. Follow the instructions at the following URL to configure Facebook at Work to use Azure AD as an identity provider: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/authentication/cloud-providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/authentication/cloud-providers)\n\n5.  Once completed, return to the browser windows showing the Azure management portal, click the checkbox to confirm you have completed the procedure, then click **Next** and **Complete**.\n\n\n## Automatically provisioning users to Facebook at Work\n\nAzure AD supports the ability to automatically synchonize the account details of assigned users to Facebook at Work. This automatic sychronization enables Facebook at Work to get the data it needs to authorize users for access, in advance of them attempting to sign-in for the first time. It also de-provisions users from Facebook at Work when access has been revoked in Azure AD.\n\nAutomatic provisioning can be set up by clicking **Configure account provisioning** in the Azure management portal window.\n\nFor additional details on how to configure automatic provisioning, see [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/provisioning/cloud-providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/provisioning/cloud-providers)\n\n\n## Assigning users to Facebook at Work\n\nFor provisioned AAD users to be able to see Facebook at Work on their Access Panel, they must be assigned access inside the Azure management portal.\n\n**To assign users to Facebook at Work:**\n\n1.  On the start page for Facebook at Work in the Azure management portal, click **Assign accounts**.\n\n2.  In the **Show** menu, select whether you want to assign a user or a group to Facebook at Work and click the Checkmark button.\n\n3.  In the resulting list, select the users or group to whom you want to assign Facebook at Work.\n\n4.  In the page footer, click the **Assign** button.\n\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n* [List of Tutorials on How to Integrate SaaS Apps with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-saas-tutorial-list.md)\n* [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory?](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md)\n\n<!--Image references-->\n[1]: ./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_01.png\n[2]: ./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_02.png\n[3]: ./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_03.png\n[4]: ./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_04.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
