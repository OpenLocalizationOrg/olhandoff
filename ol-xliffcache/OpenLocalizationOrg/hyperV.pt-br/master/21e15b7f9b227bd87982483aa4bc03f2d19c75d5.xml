  "content": "## Send a cloud-to-device message from the app back end\n\nIn this section, you'll write a Windows console app that sends cloud-to-device messages to the simulated device app.\n\n1. In the current Visual Studio solution, create a new Visual C# Desktop App project using the **Console  Application** project template. Name the project **SendCloudToDevice**.\n\n    ![][20]\n\n2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the solution, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**. \n\n    This displays the Manage NuGet Packages window.\n\n3. Search for `Microsoft Azure Devices`, click **Install**, and accept the terms of use. \n\n    This downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT - Service SDK NuGet package].\n\n4. Add the following `using` statement at the top of the **Program.cs** file:\n\n        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;\n\n5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class, substituting the placeholder value with the IoT hub connection string from [Get started with IoT Hub]:\n\n        static ServiceClient serviceClient;\n        static string connectionString = \"{iot hub connection string}\";\n\n6. Add the following method to the **Program** class:\n\n        private async static Task SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync()\n        {\n            var commandMessage = new Message(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(\"Cloud to device message.\"));\n            await serviceClient.SendAsync(\"myFirstDevice\", commandMessage);\n        }\n\n    This method will send a new cloud-to-device message to the device with id `myFirstDevice`. Change this parameter accordingly, in case you modified from the one used in [Get started with IoT Hub].\n\n7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Send Cloud-to-Device message\\n\");\n        serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to send a C2D message.\");\n        Console.ReadLine();\n        SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync().Wait();\n        Console.ReadLine();\n\n8. From within Visual Studio, right click your solution and select **Set StartUp projects...**. Select **Multiple startup projects**, then select the **Start** action for **ProcessDeviceToCloudMessages**, **SimulatedDevice**, and **SendCloudToDevice**.\n\n9.  Press **F5**, and you should see all three application start. Select the **SendCloudToDevice** windows and press **Enter**: you should see the message being received by the simulated app.\n\n    ![][21]\n\n## Receiving delivery feedback\nIt is possible to request delivery (or expiration) ackownledgments from IoT Hub for each cloud-to-device message. This enables the cloud back end to easily inform retry or compensation logic. Refer to the [IoT Hub Developer Guide][IoT Hub Developer Guide - C2D] for more information on cloud-to-device feedback.\n\nIn this section, you will modify the **SendCloudToDevice** app to request feedback and receive them from IoT Hub.\n\n1. In Visual Studio, in the **SendCloudToDevice** project, add the following method to the **Program** class.\n   \n        private async static void ReceiveFeedbackAsync()\n        {\n            var feedbackReceiver = serviceClient.GetFeedbackReceiver();\n\n            Console.WriteLine(\"\\nReceiving c2d feedback from service\");\n            while (true)\n            {\n                var feedbackBatch = await feedbackReceiver.ReceiveAsync();\n                if (feedbackBatch == null) continue;\n\n                Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Received feedback: {0}\", string.Join(\", \", feedbackBatch.Records.Select(f => f.StatusCode)));\n                Console.ResetColor();\n\n                await feedbackReceiver.CompleteAsync(feedbackBatch);\n            }\n        }\n\n    Note that the receive pattern is the same one used to receive cloud-to-device messages from the device app.\n\n2. Add the following method in the **Main** method right after the `serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString)` line:\n\n        ReceiveFeedbackAsync();\n\n3. In order to request feedback for the delivery of your cloud-to-device message, you have to specify a property in the **SendCloudToDeviceMessageAsync** method. Add the following line, right after the `var commandMessage = new Message(...);` line:\n\n        commandMessage.Ack = DeliveryAcknowledgement.Full;\n\n4.  Run the apps by pressing **F5**, and you should see all three application start. Select the **SendCloudToDevice** windows and press **Enter**: you should see the message being received by the simulated app, and after a few seconds, the feedback message being received by your **SendCloudToDevice** app.\n\n    ![][22]\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] For simplicity's sake, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy.
