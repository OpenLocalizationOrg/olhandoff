Single page and other JavaScript apps that run primarily in a browser face a few interesting challenges when it comes to authentication:\n\n- The security characteristics of these apps are significantly different from traditional server based web applications.\n- Many authorization servers & identity providers do not support CORS requests for well-documented security reasons.\n- Full page browser redirects away from the app become particularly invasive to the user experience.\n\nFor these applications (think: AngularJS, Ember.js, React.js, etc) Azure AD support the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow.  The implicit flow is described in the [OAuth 2.0 Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2).  Its primary benefit is that it allows the app to get tokens from Azure AD without performing a backend server credential exchange.  This allows the app to sign in the user, maintain session, and get tokens to other web APIs all within the client JavaScript code.  There are a few important security considerations to take into account when using the implicit flow - specifically around [client](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3) and [user impersonation](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3).\n\nIf you want to use the implicit flow and Azure AD to add authentication to your JavaScript app, we recommend you use our open source JavaScript library, [adal.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js).  There are few AngularJS tutorials available [here](active-directory-appmodel-v2-overview.md#getting-started) to help you get started.  \n\nHowever, if you would prefer not to use a library in your single page app and send protocol messages yourself, follow the general steps below.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]\n    This information applies to the v2.0 app model public preview.  For instructions on how to integrate with the generally available Azure AD service, please refer to the [Azure Active Directory Developer Guide](active-directory-developers-guide.md).\n\n## Send the Sign-In Request\n\nTo initially sign the user into your app, you can send an [OpenID Connect](active-directory-v2-protocols-oidc.md) authorization request and get an `id_token` from the v2.0 endpoint:\n\n```\n// Line breaks for legibility only\n\nGET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?\nclient_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e      // Your registered Application Id\n&response_type=id_token\n&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F       // Your registered Redirect Uri, url encoded\n&response_mode=fragment\n&scope=openid%20\nhttps%3A%2F%2Fgraph.windows.net%2Fdirectory.read%20\n&state=12345\n&nonce=678910\n```\n\n| Parameter | | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |\n| client_id | required | The Application Id that the registration portal ([apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)) assigned your app. |\n| response_type | required | Must include `id_token` for OpenID Connect sign-in.  It may also include other response_types, such as `code`. |\n| redirect_uri | required | The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app.  It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the portal, except it must be url encoded. |\n| scope | required | A space-separated list of scopes.  For OpenID Connect, it must include the scope `openid`, which translates to the \"Sign in & Read Your Profile\" permission in the consent UI.  You may also include other scopes in this request for requesting consent.  |\n| nonce | required | A value included in the request, generated by the app, that will be included in the resulting id_token as a claim.  The app can then verify this value to mitigate token replay attacks.  The value is typically a randomized, unique string that can be used to identify the origin of the request.  |\n| response_mode | recommended | Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting authorization_code back to your app.  Can be one of 'query', 'form_post', or 'fragment'.  \n| state | recommended | A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response.  It can be a string of any content that you wish.  A randomly generated unique value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks.  The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |\n| prompt | optional | Indicates the type of user interaction that is required.  The only valid values at this time are 'login', 'none', and 'consent'.  `prompt=login` will force the user to enter their credentials on that request, negating single-sign on.  `prompt=none` is the opposite - it will ensure that the user is not presented with any interactive prompt whatsoever.  If the request cannot be completed silently via single-sign on, the v2.0 endpoint will return an error.  `prompt=consent` will trigger the OAuth consent dialog after the user signs in, asking the user to grant permissions to the app. |\n| login_hint | optional | Can be used to pre-fill the username/email address field of the sign in page for the user. |\n\nAt this point, the user will be asked to enter their credentials and complete the authentication.  The v2.0 endpoint will also ensure that the user has consented to the permissions indicated in the `scope` query parameter.  If the user has not consented to any of those permissions, it will ask the user to consent to the required permissions.  Details of [permissions, consent, and multi-tenant apps are provided here](active-directory-v2-scopes.md).\n\nOnce the user authenticates and grants consent, the v2.0 endpoint will return a response to your app at the indicated `redirect_uri`, using the method specified in the `response_mode` parameter.\n\nA successful response using `response_mode=fragment` looks like:\n\n```\nGET https://localhost/myapp/#\nid_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...   // the id_token, truncated\n&session_state=7B29111D-C220-4263-99AB-6F6E135D75EF            // a value generated by the v2.0 endpoint\n&state=12345                                                    // the value provided in the request\n&id_token_expires_in=3600\n\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| id_token | The id_token that the  app requested. You can use the id_token to verify the user's identity and begin a session with the user.  More details on id_tokens and their contents is included in the [v2.0 endpoint token reference](active-directory-v2-tokens.md).  |\n| session_state | A unique value that identifies the current user session. This value is a GUID, but should be treated as an opaque value that is passed without examination. |\n| state | If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The  app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical. |\n| id_token_expires_in | How long the id token is valid (in seconds). |\n\nError responses may also be sent to the `redirect_uri` so the app can handle them appropriately:\n\n```\nGET https://localhost/myapp/#\nerror=access_denied\n&error_description=the+user+canceled+the+authentication\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| error | An error code string that can be used to classify types of errors that occur, and can be used to react to errors. |\n| error_description | A specific error message that can help a developer identify the root cause of an authentication error.  |\n\n## Validate the id_token\nJust receiving an id_token is not sufficient to authenticate the user; you must validate the id_token's signature and verify the claims in the token per your app's requirements.  The v2.0 endpoint uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html) and public key cryptography to sign tokens and verify that they are valid.\n\nThe v2.0 app model has an OpenID Connect metadata endpoint, which allows an app to fetch information about the v2.0 app model at runtime.  This information includes endpoints, token contents, and token signing keys.  The metadata endpoint contains a JSON document located at:\n\n`https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration`\n\nOne of the properties of this configuration document is the `jwks_uri`, whose value for the v2.0 app model will be:\n\n`https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys`.\n\nYou can use the RSA256 public keys located at this endpoint to validate the signature of the id_token.  There are multiple keys listed at this endpoint at any given point in time, each identified by a `kid`.  The header of the id_token also contains a `kid` claim, which indicates which of these keys was used to sign the id_token.  \n\nSee the [v2.0 app model token reference](active-directory-v2-tokens.md) for more information, including [Validating Tokens](active-directory-v2-tokens.md#validating-tokens) and [Important Information About Signing Key Rollover](active-directory-v2-tokens.md#validating-tokens).\n<!--TODO: Improve the information on this-->\n\nYou can choose to validate the `id_token` in the client code, but a common practice is to send the `id_token` to a backend server and perform the validation there.  There are many libraries available for parsing and validating JWT tokens.  Once you've validated the signature of the id_token, there are a few claims you will need to verify:\n\n- You should validate the `nonce` claim to prevent token replay attacks.  Its value should be what you specified in the sign-in request.\n- You should validate the `aud` claim to ensure the id_token was issued for your app.  Its value should be the `client_id` of your app.\n- You should validate the `iat` and `exp` claims to ensure the id_token has not expired.\n\nYou may also wish to validate additional claims depending on your scenario.  Some common validations include:\n\n- Ensuring the user/organization has signed up for the app.\n- Ensuring the user has proper authorization/privileges\n- Ensuring a certain strength of authentication has occurred, such as multi-factor authentication.\n\nFor more information on the claims in an id_token, see the [v2.0 app model token reference](active-directory-v2-tokens.md).\n\nOnce you have completely validated the id_token, you can begin a session with the user and use the claims in the id_token to obtain information about the user in your app.  This information can be used for display, records, authorizations, etc.\n\n## Get Access Tokens\n\nNow that you've signed the user into your single page app, you can get access tokens for calling web APIs secured by Azure AD, such as the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).  In the normal OpenID Connect/OAuth flow, you would do this by making a request to the v2.0 `/token` endpoint.  However, the v2.0 endpoint does not support CORS requests, so making AJAX calls to get and refresh tokens is out of the question.  Instead, you can use the implicit flow in a hidden iframe to get new tokens for other web APIs: \n\n```\n// Line breaks for legibility only\n\nGET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?\nclient_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e      // Your registered Application Id\n&response_type=token\n&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F       // Your registered Redirect Uri, url encoded\n&response_mode=fragment\n&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.windows.net%2Fdirectory.read  // The space separated scope(s) you want an access token for\n&state=12345\n&prompt=none\n&login_hint=joe.user@outlook.com\n&domain_hint=consumers\n```\n\n| Parameter | | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------- |\n| client_id | required | The Application Id that the registration portal ([apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)) assigned your app. |\n| response_type | required | Must be `token`for the implicit flow. |\n| redirect_uri | required | The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app.  It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the portal, except it must be url encoded. |\n| scope | required | A space-separated list of scopes you need in the access token. |\n| response_mode | recommended | Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting authorization_code back to your app.  Can be one of 'query', 'form_post', or 'fragment'.  \n| state | recommended | A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response.  It can be a string of any content that you wish.  A randomly generated unique value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks.  The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |\n| prompt | required | Here we use `prompt=none` to specify that Azure AD should not present any UI.  Because this request takes place in a hidden iframe, you want to ensure that if the token cannot be silently acquired, Azure AD should return an error instead of asking the user to sign in. |\n| login_hint | required | Required for silent authentication.  This hint helps Azure AD to distinguish between multiple accounts if the user has an active session with more than one account.  The value provided here can be the exact value that you receive in the `preferred_uesrname` claim in the id_token.  |\n| domain_hint | required | Required for silent authentication.  For this flow, the domain_hint can be one of two values: `consumers` or `organizations`.  If the value of the `tid` claim in the `id_token` you received was exactly '9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad', use `consumers` as the domain_hint.  Otherwise, use `organizations`. |\n\nThanks to the `prompt=none` parameter, this request will either succeed or fail immediately and return to your application.  A successful response will be sent to your app at the indicated `redirect_uri`, using the method specified in the `response_mode` parameter.\n\nA successful response using `response_mode=fragment` looks like:\n\n```\nGET https://localhost/myapp/#\naccess_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...   // the access_token, truncated\n&session_state=7B29111D-C220-4263-99AB-6F6E135D75EF            // a value generated by the v2.0 endpoint\n&state=12345                                                    // the value provided in the request\n&expires_in=3600\n&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.windows.net%2Fdirectory.read\n\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| access_token | The token that the app requested. |\n| session_state | A unique value that identifies the current user session. This value is a GUID, but should be treated as an opaque value that is passed without examination. |\n| state | If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The  app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical. |\n| expires_in | How long the access token is valid (in seconds). |\n| scope | The scopes that the access token is valid for. |\n\nError responses may also be sent to the `redirect_uri` so the app can handle them appropriately.  In the case of `prompt=none`, an expected error will be:\n\n```\nGET https://localhost/myapp/#\nerror=user_authentication_required\n&error_description=the+request+could+not+be+completed+silently\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| error | An error code string that can be used to classify types of errors that occur, and can be used to react to errors. |\n| error_description | A specific error message that can help a developer identify the root cause of an authentication error.  |\n\nIf you receive this error in the iframe request, the user must interactively sign in again to retrieve a new token.  You can choose to handle this case in whatever way makes sense for your application.\n\n## Refreshing Tokens\n\nBoth `id_token`s and `access_token`s will expire after a short period of time, so your app must be prepared to refresh these tokens periodically.  To refresh either type of token, you can perform the same hidden iframe request from above using the `prompt=none` parameter to control Azure AD's behavior.  If you want to receive a new `id_token`, be sure to use `response_type=id_token` and `scope=openid`, as well as a `nonce` parameter.\n\n\n## Send a Sign Out Request\n\nThe OpenIdConnect `end_session_endpoint` is not currently supported by the v2.0 app model preview. This means your app cannot send a request to the v2.0 endpoint to end a user's session and clear cookies set by the v2.0 endpoint.\nTo sign a user out, your app can simply end its own session with the user, and leave the user's session with the v2.0 endpoint in-tact.  The next time the user tries to sign in, they will see a \"choose account\" page, with their actively signed-in accounts listed.\nOn that page, the user can choose to sign out of any account, ending the session with the v2.0 endpoint.\n\n<!--\n\nWhen you wish to sign the user out of the  app, it is not sufficient to clear your app's cookies or otherwise end the session with the user.  You must also redirect the user to the v2.0 endpoint for sign out.  If you fail to do so, the user will be able to re-authenticate to your app without entering their credentials again, because they will have a valid single sign-on session with the v2.0 endpoint.\n\nYou can simply redirect the user to the `end_session_endpoint` listed in the OpenID Connect metadata document:\n\n```\nGET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/logout?\npost_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F\n```\n\n| Parameter | | Description |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |\n| post_logout_redirect_uri | recommended | The URL which the user should be redirected to after successful logout.  If not included, the user will be shown a generic message by the v2.0 endpoint.  |\n\n-->\n\n"
