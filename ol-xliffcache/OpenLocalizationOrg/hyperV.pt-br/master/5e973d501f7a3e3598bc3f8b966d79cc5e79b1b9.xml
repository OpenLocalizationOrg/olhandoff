You can simply copy a virtual machine and its associated files to the new host, and then use the **Import Virtual Machine** wizard to specify the location of the files. This registers the virtual machine with Hyper-V and makes it available to be used.\n\n## Export virtual machines\nAn easy way to prepare virtual machines to be imported is the **Export Virtual Machine** wizard.\n\n1. In Hyper-V Manager, select one or multiple virtual machines, right-click on your selection and select **Export**.\n2. Click **Browse** in the dialog box and choose where you would like to put the exported VM(s) and then click **Select Folder**.\n3. In the **Export Virtual Machine** dialog, click **Export**.\n\nFor information about using Windows PowerShell to export virtual machines, see [Export-VM](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh848491.aspx)\n\n## Import virtual machines\n1. In **Hyper-V Manager**, in the **Action** menu, click **Import Virtual Machine**.\n2. In the Locate Folder section, click Browse and navigate to where the virtual machine files are located. <!-- to check if this is resolved - this behavior is a bug from my perspective--> Please note that using the wizard you can import one VM at a time and have to select the VM's folder instead of the general export folder. Click **Next** when finished.\n3. Select the virtual machine to import and then click **Next**.\n4. In the Choose Import Type section, you can choose how to import the virtual machine:\n  -  **Register** - Uses the existing unique ID of the virtual machine and registers it in-place. Choose this option if the virtual machines files are already in the correct location.\n  - **Restore** - Uses the original virtual machine’s unique ID and also copies the virtual machine files to the default location specified for the host.\n  - **Copy** - Creates a new unique ID for the virtual machine and also copies the virtual machine files to the default location specified for the host.\n\n5. After selecting how to import the VM, click **Next**.\n6. In the Choose Destination section, you can choose where to store the files for the virtual machine or leave them in their current location. When you are finished, click **Next**.\n7. In Choose Storage folders, you can select another place to store the .vhdx file or leave them where they are. When you are finished, click **Next**.\n8.

Creates a copy of the virtual machine configuration file. This is done as a precaution in case an unexpected restart occurs on the host, such as from a power outage.\n2. Validates hardware.
