When using topics and subscriptions, components of a distributed application do not communicate directly with each other; instead they exchange messages via a topic, which acts as an intermediary.\n\n![TopicConcepts](./media/howto-service-bus-topics/sb-topics-01.png)\n\nIn contrast with Service Bus queues, in which each message is processed by a single consumer, topics and subscriptions provide a \"one-to-many\" form of communication, using a publish/subscribe pattern. It is possible to\nregister multiple subscriptions to a topic. When a message is sent to a topic, it is then made available to each subscription to handle/process independently.\n\nA subscription to a topic resembles a virtual queue that receives copies of the messages that were sent to the topic. You can optionally register filter rules for a topic on a per-subscription basis, which allows you to filter/restrict which messages to a topic are received by which topic subscriptions.\n\nService Bus topics and subscriptions enable you to scale and process a very large number of messages across a very large number of users and applications.\n\n## Create a service namespace\n\nTo begin using Service Bus topics and subscriptions in Azure, you must first create a service namespace. A namespace provides a scoping container for addressing Service Bus resources within your application.\n\nTo create a service namespace:\n\n1.  Log on to the [Azure classic portal][].\n\n2.  In the left navigation pane of the portal, click **Service Bus**.\n\n3.  In the lower pane of the portal, click **Create**.   \n    ![][0]\n\n4.
