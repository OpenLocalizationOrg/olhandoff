The first two topics in bold are required before you start the upgrade from DirSync.\n\n| Topic |  |\n| --------- | --------- |\n| **Download Azure AD Connect** | [Download Azure AD Connect](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615771) |\n| **Hardware and prerequisites** | [Azure AD Connect: Hardware and prerequisites](active-directory-aadconnect-prerequisites.md) |\n| **Accounts used for installation** | [More about Azure AD Connect accounts and permissions](active-directory-aadconnect-accounts-permissions.md) |\n\n## Upgrade from DirSync\nDepending on your current DirSync deployment there are different options for the upgrade. If the expected upgrade time is less than 3 hours then we recommend to do an in-place upgrade. If the expected upgrade time is more than 3 hours we recommend to do a parallel deployment on another server. It is estimated that if you have more than 50,000 objects it will take more than 3 hours to do the upgrade.\n\n| Scenario | |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| [In-place upgrade](#in-place-upgrade)  | Preferred option if the upgrade is expected to take less than 3 hours. |\n| [Parallel deployment](#parallel-deployment) | Preferred option if the upgrade is expected to take more than 3 hours. |\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] When you plan to upgrade from DirSync to Azure AD Connect, do not uninstall DirSync yourself before the upgrade. Azure AD Connect will read and migrate the configuration from DirSync and uninstall after inspecting the server.\n\n**In-place upgrade**\n\nThe expected time to complete the upgrade is displayed by the wizard.  This estimate is based on the assumption it will take 3 hours to complete an upgrade for a database with 50,000 objects (users, contacts, and groups).  Azure AD Connect will analyze your current DirSync settings and recommend an in-place upgrade if the number of objects in your database is less than 50,000.  If you decide to continue, your current settings will be automatically applied during upgrade and your server will automatically resume active synchronization.\n\nIf you want to do a configuration migration and do a parallel deployment you can override the in-place upgrade recommendation. You might for example take the opportunity to refresh the hardware and operating system. See the [parallel deployment](#parallel-deployment) section for more information.\n\n**Parallel deployment**\n\nUsing a parallel deployment is recommended if you have more than 50,000 objects. This will avoid any operational delays experienced by your users. The Azure AD Connect installation will attempt to estimate the downtime for the upgrade, but if you've upgraded DirSync in the past, your own experience is likely to be the best guide.\n\n### Supported DirSync configurations to be upgraded\nThe following configuration changes are supported with DirSync and will be upgraded:\n\n- Domain and OU filtering\n- Alternate ID (UPN)\n- Password sync and Exchange hybrid settings\n- Your forest/domain and Azure AD settings\n- Filtering based on user attributes\n\nThe following changes cannot be upgraded. If you have made any of these changes the upgrade will be blocked.\n\n![Upgrade blocked](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/analysisblocked.png)\n\nIn those cases the recommendation is to install a new Azure AD Connect server in [staging mode](active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations.md#staging-mode) and verify the old DirSync and new Azure AD Connect configuration. Reapply any changes using custom configuration, as described in [Azure AD Connect Sync custom configuration](active-directory-aadconnectsync-whatis.md).\n\n- Unsupported DirSync changes, e.g. removed attributes and using a custom extension DLL\n\nThe passwords used by DirSync for the service accounts cannot be retrieved and will not be migrated. These passwords will be reset during the upgrade.\n\n### High-level steps for upgrading from DirSync to Azure AD Connect\n\n1. Welcome to Azure AD Connect\n2. Analysis of current DirSync configuration\n3. Collect Azure AD global admin password\n4. Collect credentials for an enterprise admin account (only used during the installation of Azure AD Connect)\n5. Installation of Azure AD Connect\n    * Uninstall DirSync\n    * Install Azure AD Connect\n    * Optionally begin synchronization\n\nAdditional steps are required when:\n\n* You're currently using Full SQL Server - local or remote\n* You have more than 50,000 objects in scope for synchronization\n\n## In-place upgrade\n\n1. Launch the Azure AD Connect installer (MSI).\n2. Review and agree to license terms and privacy notice.\n![Welcome to Azure AD](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/Welcome.png)\n3. Click next to begin analysis of your existing DirSync installation.\n![Analyzing existing Directory Sync installation](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/Analyze.png)\n4. When the analysis completes, we will make recommendations on how to proceed.  \n    - If you use SQL Server Express and have less than 50,000 objects, the following screen is shown:\n![Analysis completed ready to upgrade from DirSync](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/AnalysisReady.png)\n    - If you use a full SQL Server for DirSync you will see this page instead:\n![Analysis completed ready to upgrade from DirSync](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/AnalysisReadyFullSQL.png)<BR/>\nThe information regarding the existing SQL Server database server being used by DirSync is displayed. Make appropriate adjustments if needed. Click **Next** to continue the installation.\n    - If you have more than 50,000 objects you will see this screen instead:\n![Analysis completed ready to upgrade from DirSync](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/AnalysisRecommendParallel.png)<BR/>\nTo proceed with an in-place upgrade, click the checkbox next to this message: **Continue upgrading DirSync on this computer.**\nTo do a [parallel deployment](#parallel-deployment) instead you will export the DirSync configuration settings and move those to the new server.\n5. Provide the password for the account you currently use to connect to Azure AD. This must be the account currently used by DirSync.\n![Enter your Azure AD credentials](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/ConnectToAzureAD.png)\n6. Provide an enterprise admin account for Active Directory.\n![Enter your ADDS credentials](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/ConnectToADDS.png)\n7. You're now ready to configure.  When you click **Upgrade**, DirSync will be uninstalled and Azure AD Connect will be configured and begin synchronizing.\n![Ready to configure](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/ReadyToConfigure.png)\n\n\n## Parallel deployment\n\n### Export the DirSync configuration\n**Parallel deployment with more than 50,000 objects**\n\nIf you have more than 50,000 objects the Azure AD Connect installation will recommend a parallel deployment.\n\nA screen similar to the following will be displayed:\n\n![Analysis complete](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/AnalysisRecommendParallel.png)\n\nIf you want to proceed with parallel deployment you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n- Click the **Export settings** button.  When you install Azure AD Connect on a separate server these settings will be imported to migrate any settings from your current DirSync to your new Azure AD Connect installation.\n\nOnce your settings have been successfully exported, you can exit the Azure AD Connect wizard on the DirSync server. Continue with the next step to [install Azure AD Connect on a separate server](#installation-of-azure-ad-connect-on-separate-server)\n\n**Parallel deployment with less than 50,000 objects**\n\nIf you have less than 50,000 objects but still want to do a parallel deployment, then do the following:\n\n1. Run the Azure AD Connect installer (MSI).\n2. When you see the **Welcome to Azure AD Connect** screen, exit the installation wizard by clicking the \"X\" in the top right corner of the window.\n3. Open a command prompt.\n4. From the install location of Azure AD Connect (Default: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect) execute the following command:\n    `AzureADConnect.exe /ForceExport`.\n5. Click the **Export settings** button.  When you install Azure AD Connect on a separate server these settings will be imported to migrate any settings from your current DirSync to your new Azure AD Connect installation.\n\n![Analysis complete](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/forceexport.png)\n\nOnce your settings have been successfully exported, you can exit the Azure AD Connect wizard on the DirSync server. Continue with the next step to [install Azure AD Connect on a separate server](#installation-of-azure-ad-connect-on-separate-server)\n\n### Install Azure AD Connect on separate server\n\nWhen you install Azure AD Connect on a new server it will assume that you want to perform a clean install of Azure AD Connect. Since you want to use the DirSync configuration there are some extra steps to take:\n\n1. Run the Azure AD Connect installer (MSI).\n2. When you see the **Welcome to Azure AD Connect** screen, exit the installation wizard by clicking the \"X\" in the top right corner of the window.\n3. Open a command prompt.\n4. From the install location of Azure AD Connect (Default: C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect) execute the following command:\n    `AzureADConnect.exe /migrate`.\n    The Azure AD Connect installation wizard starts and presents you with the following screen:\n![Enter your Azure AD credentials](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/ImportSettings.png)\n5. Select the settings file that exported from your DirSync installation.\n6. Configure any advanced options including:\n    - A custom installation location for Azure AD Connect.\n    - An existing instance of SQL Server (Default: Azure AD Connect installs SQL Server 2012 Express). Do not use the same database instance as your DirSync server.\n    - A service account used to connect to SQL Server (If your SQL Server database is remote then this account must be a domain service account).\nThese options can be seen on this screen:\n![Enter your Azure AD credentials](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/advancedsettings.png)\n7. Click **Next**.\n8. On the **Ready to configure** page, leave the **Start the synchronization process as soon as the configuration completes** checked. The server will be in [staging mode](active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations.md#staging-mode) so changes will not be exported to Azure AD at this time.\n9. Click **Install**.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] Synchronization between Windows Server Active Directory and Azure Active Directory will begin, but no changes will be exported to Azure AD.  Only one synchronization tool can be actively exporting changes at a time. This is called [staging mode](active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations.md#staging-mode).\n\n### Verify that Azure AD Connect is ready to begin synchronization\n\nIn order to verify that Azure AD Connect is ready to take over from DirSync you will need to open  **Synchronization Service Manager** in the group **Azure AD Connect** from the start menu.\n\nWithin the application you will need to view the **Operations** tab. On this tab you are looking to confirm that the following operations have been completed:\n\n- Import on the AD Connector\n- Import on the Azure AD Connector\n- Full Sync on the AD Connector\n- Full Sync on the Azure AD Connector\n\n![Import and Sync Completed](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/importsynccompleted.png)\n\nReview the result from these operations and ensure there are no errors.\n\nIf you want to see and inspect which changes are about to be exported to Azure AD, then read how to verify the configuration under [staging mode](active-directory-aadconnectsync-operations.md#staging-mode). Make required configuration changes until you do not see anything unexpected.\n\nOnce these 4 operations have been completed, there are no errors, and you are satisfied with the changes which are about to be exported, you are ready to uninstall DirSync and enable Azure AD Connect synchronization. Complete the next two steps to complete the migration.\n\n### Uninstall DirSync (old server)\n\n- From **Programs and features** locate **Windows Azure Active Directory sync tool**\n- Uninstall **Windows Azure Active Directory sync tool**\n- Note that the uninstallation might take up to 15 minutes to complete.\n\nWith DirSync uninstalled, there is no active server exporting to Azure AD. The next step must be completed before any changes in your on-premises Active Directory will continue to be synchronized to Azure AD.\n\n### Enable Azure AD Connect (new server)\nAfter installation, re-opening Azure AD connect will allow you to make additional configuration changes. Start **Azure AD Connect** from the start menu or from the shortcut on the desktop. Make sure you do not try to run the installation MSI again.\n\nYou should see the following:\n\n![Additional tasks](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/AdditionalTasks.png)\n\n- Select **Configure staging mode**.\n- Turn off staging by unchecking the **Enabled staging mode** checkbox.\n\n![Enter your Azure AD credentials](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-upgrade-get-started/configurestaging.png)\n\n- Click the **Next** button\n- On the confirmation page, click on the **install** button.\n\nAzure AD Connect is now your active server.\n\n## Next steps\nNow that you have Azure AD Connect installed you can [verify the installation and assign licenses](active-directory-aadconnect-whats-next.md).\n\nLearn more about [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-aadconnect.md).\n\n\n"
