This tab is key to understand and troubleshoot issues.\n\n## Understand the information visible in the operations tab\nThe top half shows all runs in a chronical order. By default the operations log will keep information about the last 7 days, but this can be changed with the [scheduler](active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-scheduler.md). You want to look for any run which does not show a success status. You can change the sorting by clicking on the headers.\n\nThe **Status** column is the most important information and shows the most severe problem for a run. Here is a quick summary of the most common statuses in order of priority to investigate (where * indicate several possible error strings).\n\n| Status | Comment |\n| --- | --- |\n| stopped-* | The run could not complete. For example if the remote system is down and cannot be contacted. |\n| stopped-error-limit | There are more than 5,000 errors. The run was automatically stopped due to the large number of errors. |\n| completed-*-errors | The run completed, but there are errors (fewer than 5,000) which should be investigated. |\n| completed-*-warnings | The run completed, but some data is not in the expected state. If you have errors, then this is usually only a symptom. Until you have addressed errors, you should not investigate warnings. |\n| success | No issues. |\n\nWhen you select a row, the bottom will update to show the details of that run. To the far left of the bottom you might have a list saying **Step #**. This will only appear if you have multiple domains in your forest where each domain is represented by a step. The domain name can be found under the heading **Partition**. Under **Synchronization Statistics** you can find more information about the number of changes which were processed. You can click on the links to get a list of the changed objects. If you have objects with an error, those will show up under **Synchronization Errors**.\n\n## Troubleshoot errors in operations tab\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/errorsync.png)  \nWhen you have errors, both the object in error and the error itself are links which will provide more information.\n\nStart by clicking on the error string (in the picture above **sync-rule-error-function-triggered**). You will first be presented with an overview of the object. To see the actual error, click on the button **Stack Trace**. This will provide debug level information for the error.\n\n**TIP:** You can right-click in the **call stack information** box, choose **select all**, and **copy**. You can then copy the stack and look at the error in your favorite editor, such as Notepad.\n\n- If the error is from **SyncRulesEngine** then the call stack information will first have a list of all attributes on the object. Scroll down until you see the heading **InnerException =>**.  \n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/errorinnerexception.png)  \nThe line after will show the error.
