Privileged actions include elevation changes (for example, role creation or password resets), changing policy configurations (for example password policies), or changes to directory configuration (for example, changes to domain federation settings). The reports provide the audit record for the event name, the actor who performed the action, the target resource affected by the change, and the date and time (in UTC). Customers are able to retrieve the list of audit events for their Azure Active Directory via the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), as described in [View your access and usage reports](active-directory-view-access-usage-reports.md).\n\n\n## List of Audit Report Events\n<!--- audit event descriptions should be in the past tense --->\n\nEvents                               | Event Description\n------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**User events**                      |\nAdd User                             | Added a user to the directory.\nDelete User                          | Deleted a user from the directory.\nSet license properties               | Set the license properties for a user in the directory.\nReset user password                  | Reset the password for a user in the directory.\nChange user password                 | Changed the password for a user in the directory.\nChange user license                  | Changed the license assigned to a user in the directory.
