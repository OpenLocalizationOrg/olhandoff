Follow these instructions to create the necessary push certificate to send and receive notifications. For more information on these concepts see the official [Apple Push Notification Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272584) documentation.\n\nGenerate the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file, which is used by Apple to generate a signed push certificate.\n\n1. On your Mac, run the Keychain Access tool. It can be opened from the **Utilities** folder or the **Other** folder on the launch pad.\n\n2. Click **Keychain Access**, expand **Certificate Assistant**, then click **Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority...**.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-request-cert-from-ca.png)\n\n3. Select your **User Email Address** and **Common Name** , make sure that **Saved to disk** is selected, and then click **Continue**. Leave the **CA Email Address** field blank as it is not required.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-csr-info.png)\n\n4.

Remember the location chosen for this file.\n\nNext, you will register your app with Apple, enable push notifications, and upload this exported CSR to create a push certificate.\n\n##Register your app for push notifications\n\nTo be able to send push notifications to an iOS app, you must register your application with Apple and also register for push notifications.  \n\n1. If you have not already registered your app, navigate to the <a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=272456\" target=\"_blank\">iOS Provisioning Portal</a> at the Apple Developer Center, log on with your Apple ID, click **Identifiers**, then click **App IDs**, and finally click on the **+** sign to register a new app.\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-ios-appids.png)\n\n\n2. Update the following three fields for your new app and then click **Continue**:\n\n    * **Name**: Type a descriptive name for your app in the **Name** field in the **App ID Description** section.\n    \n    * **Bundle Identifier**: Under the **Explicit App ID** section, enter a **Bundle Identifier** in the form `<Organization Identifier>.<Product Name>` as mentioned in the [App Distribution Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringYourApp/ConfiguringYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH28-SW8). The *Organization Identifier* and *Product Name* you use must match the organization identifier and product name you will use when you create your XCode project. In the screeshot below *NotificationHubs* is used as a organization idenitifier and *GetStarted* is used as the product name. Making sure this matches the values you will use in your XCode project will allow you to use the correct publishing profile with XCode. \n    \n    * **Push Notifications**: Check the **Push Notifications** option in the **App Services** section, .\n\n    ![](./media/notification-hubs-enable-apple-push-notifications/notification-hubs-new-appid-info.png)\n\n    This generates your app ID and requests you to confirm the information.
