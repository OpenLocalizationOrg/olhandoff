This allows you to invoke RFCs, BAPIs, tRFCs as well as send IDocs to the SAP server, even if it sits behind your on-premises firewall.\n\nIf you have an on-premises SAP server, use a hybrid listener to establish connectivity with the SAP connector as shown:\n\n![Hybrid connectivity flow][1]\n\nWhile an SAP Connector in the cloud cannot directly connect to an SAP server behind a firewall on-premises, you can use the Hybrid listener to bridge the gap. You set this up by hosting a relay endpoint that allows the connector to securely establish connectivity to the SAP server.\n\n\n## Different ways to integrate with SAP\nThe following actions are supported:\n\n- Call RFC\n- Call tRFC\n- Call BAPI\n- Send IDoc\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe SAP specific client libraries are required on the client machine where the hybrid listener is installed and running. The precise details are captured [here][9] under the section titled **For the SAP adapter**.\n\n\n## Create a new SAP Connector\n1. Sign in to the Azure portal.\n2. Select **New**.\n3. In the create blade, select **Compute** > **Azure Marketplace**.\n4. In the marketplace blade, select **API Apps**, and search for SAP in the search bar:  \n    ![SAP Connector API App][2]\n5. Select the **SAP Connector** published by Microsoft.\n6. In the SAP connector blade, select **Create**.\n7. In the new blade that opens, enter the following:  \n    1. **Location** - Choose the geographic location where you would like the connector to deploy\n    2. **Subscription** - Choose a subscription you want this connector to be created in\n    3. **Resource group** - Select or create a resource group where the connector should reside\n    4. **Web hosting plan** - Select or create a web hosting plan\n    5. **Pricing tier** - Choose a pricing tier for the connector\n    6. **Name** - Enter a name for your SAP Connector\n    7. **Package settings**\n        - **Server name** - Enter the SAP Server name. Example: \"SAPserver\" or \"SAPserver.mydomain.com\".\n        - **User name** - Enter a valid user name to connect to the SAP server.\n        - **Password** - Enter a valid password to connect to the SAP server.\n        - **System number** - Enter the system number of the SAP Application server.\n        - **Language** - Enter the logon language, like \"EN\". If no value is entered, \"EN\" is considered.\n        - **On-premises** - Enter whether your SAP server is on-premises behind a firewall or not. If set to TRUE, you need to install a listener agent on a server that can access your SAP server. You can go to your API App summary page and select 'Hybrid Connection' to install the agent.\n        - **Service bus connection string** - Enter this parameter if your SAP Server is on-premises. This should be a valid Service Bus Namespace connection string.\n        - **RFCs** - Enter the RFCs in SAP that are allowed to be called by the connector.\n        - **TRFCs** - Enter the TRFCs in SAP that are allowed to be called by the connector.\n        - **BAPI** - Enter the BAPIs in SAP that are allowed to be called by the connector.\n        - **IDOCs** - Enter the IDOCs in SAP that can be sent by the connector.\n    8. Select Select. Within a few minutes, your SAP connector is created.\n\n\n## Install the hybrid listener\nBrowse to the SAP connector you created: **Browse** > **API Apps** > *name of your connector*\n\nIn the connector blade, notice that the Hybrid connection status is pending. Select Hybrid Connection. The Hybrid Connection blade opens:  \n\n![Hybrid connection blade][3]\n\nCopy the primary gateway configuration string. You will use it later as part of the hybrid listener's configuration.\n\nSelect the **Download and configure** link. The click once installer opens:\n\n![Hybrid connection click once installer][4]\n\nSelect **Install**, and then enter the primary gateway configuration string you previously copied:\n\n![Relay listen connection string][5]\n\nSelect **Install** to complete the Hybrid connection manager setup:\n\n![Hybrid connection manager installation in progress][6]\n\n![Hybrid connection manager installation completed][7]\n\n## Validate the hybrid connection\nBrowse to the SAP connector you created: **Browse** > **API Apps** > *name of your connector*\n\nIn the connector blade, notice that the Hybrid connection status is *Connected*:\n\n![Hybrid connection status - connected][8]\n\n\n## Using the SAP connector in Logic Apps\nOnce the SAP connector is created, it can be used inside your Logic Apps workflow. To do this, create a new Logic App through **New** > **Logic Apps** > **Create**. Enter the metadata for the Logic App, including the resource group.\n\nSelect **Triggers and actions**. The Logic Apps workflow designer opens.\n\nSelect the SAP connector from the right pane, and select an action from the Actions tab.\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] The list of actions are based on the configuration you entered when you created the SAP connector.\n\nFor the selected action, you see the input and output parameters. You can enter in the inputs for the action and use the output of the current action in other API Apps, possibly for further decision making in the workflow.\n\n<!--Image references-->\n[1]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/HybridConnectivityFlow.PNG\n[2]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/SAPConnector.APIApp.PNG\n[3]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/HybridConnection.PNG\n[4]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/HybridConnection.ClickOnceInstaller.PNG\n[5]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/HybridConnection.ClickOnceInstaller.RelayInformation.PNG\n[6]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/HybridConnectionManager.Install.InProgress.PNG\n[7]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/HybridConnectionManager.Install.Completed.PNG\n[8]: ./media/app-service-logic-integrate-with-an-on-premise-SAP-server/SAPConnector.HybridConnection.Connected.PNG\n[9]: http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/D/7/2D7CE8DF-A6C5-45F0-8319-14C3F1F9A0C7/InstallationGuide.htm\n\n\n"
