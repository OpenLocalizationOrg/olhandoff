This is achieved by allowing you to auto-scale individual \nworker pools based on metrics or schedule.\n \n![][intro]\n \nAuto-scale allows you to optimize your resource utilization by automatically growing and shrinking an \n**App Service environment** to fit your budget and or load profile.\n\n##Configuring Worker Pool Auto-scale \nYou can access the auto-scale functionality from the settings tab of the **worker pool**. \n \n![][settings-scale]\n\nFrom there the interface should be fairly familiar since this is the same experience as when scaling an \n**App Service plan**. You will be able to either enter a scale value manually\n \n![][scale-manual]\n \nOr configure an auto-scale profile:\n \n![][scale-profile]\n \nAuto-scale profiles are useful to set limits on your scale. This way you can have both a consistent \nperformance experience by setting a lower bound scale value (1) and a predictable spend cap, by \nsetting an upper bound (2). \n \n![][scale-profile2]\n \nOnce a profile is defined, metrics based auto-scale rules can be added to scale up or down the \nnumber of instances in the **worker pool** within the bounds defined by the profile.\n\n![][scale-rule]\n\n Any of the **worker pool** or **front end** metrics can be used for defining auto scale rules. These are \n the same metrics you can monitor in the resource blade graphs or set alerts for.\n \n##Auto-scale Example\nAuto-scale of an **App Service environment** can best be illustrated by walking through a scenario. \nIn this article I will walk through all the considerations necessary when setting up auto-scale and \nall the interaction that come into play when we factor in auto scaling **App Service environments** that \nare hosted in an ASE.\n\n###Scenario Introduction\nFrank is a SysAdmin for an enterprise, he has migrated a portion of the workloads he manages to an \n**App Service environment**.\n\nThe **App Service environment** is configured to manual scale as follows:\n* Front Ends: 3\n* Worker Pool 1: 10\n* Worker Pool 2: 5\n* Worker Pool 3: 5\n\n**Worker pool 1** is used for production workloads, while **worker pool 2** and **worker pool 3** \nare used for QA and development workloads.\n\nThe **App Service plans** used for QA and Dev are configured for **manual scale** but the production \n**App Service plan** is set to **auto-scale** to deal with variations in load and traffic.\n\nFrank is very familiar with the application and he knows that the peak hours for load are between \n9:00am and 6:00pm since this is a **LOB application** and is used by employees while they are in \nthe office. Usage drops after that, once users are done for that day. But there is still some load \nsince users can access it remotely with either their mobile devices or home computers. The production \n**App Service plan** is already configured to **auto-scale** based on CPU usage with the following \nrules:\n\n![][asp-scale]\n\n|   **Auto-scale Profile – Weekdays – App Service Plan**    |   **Auto-scale Profile – Weekends – App Service Plan**    |\n|   ----------------------------------------------------    |   ----------------------------------------------------    |\n|   **Name:** Weekday Profile                               |   **Name:** Weekend Profile                               |\n|   **Scale by:** Schedule and performance rules            |   **Scale by:** Schedule and performance rules            |\n|   **Profile:** Weekdays                                   |   **Profile:** Weekend                                    |\n|   **Type:** recurrence                                    |   **Type:** recurrence                                    |\n|   **Target Range:** 5 to 20 instances                     |   **Target Range:** 3 to 10 instances                     |\n|   **Days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  |   **Days:** Saturday, Sunday                              |\n|   **Start Time:** 9:00AM                                  |   **Start Time:** 9:00AM                                  |\n|   **Time zone:** UTC – 08                                 |   **Time zone:** UTC – 08                                 |\n|                                                           |                                                           |\n|   **Auto-scale Rule (Scale UP)**                          |   **Auto-scale Rule (Scale UP)**                          |\n|   **Resource:** Production (App Service Environment)      |   **Resource:** Production (App Service Environment)      |\n|   **Metric:** CPU %                                       |   **Metric:** CPU %                                       |\n|   **Operation:** Greater than 60%                         |   **Operation:** Greater than 80%                         |\n|   **Duration:** 5 Minutes                                 |   **Duration:** 10 Minutes                                |\n|   **Time Aggregation:** Average                           |   **Time Aggregation:** Average                           |\n|   **Action:** Increase count by 2                         |   **Action:** Increase count by 1                         |\n|   **Cool down (minutes):** 15                             |   **Cool down (minutes):** 20                             |\n|                                                           |                                                           |\n|   **Auto-scale Rule (Scale DOWN)**                        |   **Auto-scale Rule (Scale DOWN)**                        |\n|   **Resource:** Production (App Service Environment)      |   **Resource:** Production (App Service Environment)      |\n|   **Metric:** CPU %                                       |   **Metric:** CPU %                                       |\n|   **Operation:** Lesser than 30%                          |   **Operation:** Lesser than 20%                          |\n|   **Duration:** 10 Minutes                                |   **Duration:** 15 Minutes                                |\n|   **Time Aggregation:** Average                           |   **Time Aggregation:** Average                           |\n|   **Action:** Decrease count by 1                         |   **Action:** Decrease count by 1                         |\n|   **Cool down (minutes):** 20                             |   **Cool down (minutes):** 10                             |\n\n###App Service Plan Inflation Rate\n**App Service plans** that are configured to auto-scale, will do so at a maximum rate per hour. This rate \ncan be calculated based on the values provided on the auto-scale rule.\n\nUnderstanding and calculating the **App Service plan Inflation Rate** is important to \n**App Service environment** **worker pool** auto-scale since scale changes to a **worker pool** are \nnot instantaneous and do take some time to apply.\n\nThe **App Service plan** inflation rate is calculated as follows:\n\n![][ASP-Inflation]\n\nBased on the *Auto-scale - Scale UP* rule for the *Weekday* profile of the production \n**App Service plan** this would look as follows:\n\n![][Equation1]\n\nIn the case of the *Auto-scale – Scale UP* rule for the *Weekends* profile of the production \n**App Service plan** the formula would resolve to:\n\n![][Equation2]\n\nThis value can also be calculated for scale down operations:\n\nBased on the *Auto-scale - Scale Down* rule for the *Weekday* profile of the production \n**App Service plan** this would look as follows:\n\n![][Equation3]\n\nIn the case of the *Auto-scale – Scale Down* rule for the *Weekends* profile of the production \n**App Service plan** the formula would resolve to:  \n\n![][Equation4]\n\nWhat this means is that the production **App Service plan** can grow at a maximum rate of **8** \ninstances per hour during the week and **4** instances per hour during the weekend. And it can \nrelease instances at a maximum rate of **4** instances per hour during the week and **6** instances \nper hour during weekends.\n\nIf multiple **App Service plans** are being hosted in a **worker pool**, then the **total inflation rate** \nneeds to be calculated and this can be expressed as the *sum* of the inflation rate for all the \n**App Service plans** being hosting in that **worker pool**.\n\n![][ASP-Total-Inflation] \n\n###Using the App Service Plan Inflation rate to define worker pool auto-scale rules\n**Worker pools** that host **App Service plans** that are configured to auto-scale will need to \nbe allocate a buffer of capacity to allow for the auto-scale operations to grow/shrink the \n**App Service plan** as needed. The minimum buffer would be the calculated \n**Total App Service Plan Inflation Rate**.\n\nSince **App Service environment** scale operations take some time to apply, any change should account \nfor further demand changes that could happen while a scale operation is in progress. For this we \nrecommend using the calculated **Total App Service Plan Inflation Rate** as the minimum number of \ninstances added for each auto-scale operation.\n\nWith this Information Frank can define the following Auto-scale Profile and Rules\n\n![][Worker-Pool-Scale]\n\n|   **Auto-scale Profile – Weekdays**                       |   **Auto-scale Profile – Weekends**               |\n|

defined in the \nProfile for the **App Service plan** + buffer.\n\nThe Maximum range would be the sum of all the maximum ranges for all **App Service plans** hosted in \nthe **worker pool**.\n\nThe Increase count for the scale up rules should be set to at least 1X the \n**App Service Plan Inflation Rate** for scale up.\n\nDecrease count can be adjusted to something between 1/2X or 1X the **App Service Plan Inflation \nRate** for scale down.\n\n###Auto-scale for Front End Pool\n**Front end** auto-scale rules are simpler than for **worker pools**, the main things to look for is to \nmake sure duration of the measurement and the cooldown timers take into consideration the fact that scale \noperations on an **App Service plan** are not instantaneous.\n\nFor this scenario, Frank knows that the error rate increases once front ends reach 80% CPU utilization, \nto prevent this he sets the auto-scale rule to increase instances as follows:\n \n![][Front-End-Scale]\n  \n|   **Auto-scale
