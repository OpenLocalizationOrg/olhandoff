The back end UDR will be applied to the *BackEnd* subnet, and contain one route: \n    - **RouteToFrontend**. This route will send all traffic to the front end subnet to the **FW1** virtual machine.\n\nThe combination of these routes will ensure that all traffic destined from one subnet to another will be routed to the **FW1** virtual machine, which is being used as a virtual appliance.
