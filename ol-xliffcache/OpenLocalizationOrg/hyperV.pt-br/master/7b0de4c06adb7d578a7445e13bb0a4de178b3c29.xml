If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same virtual machine, or another one.  \n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] A virtual machine in Azure uses different types of disks -- an operating system disk, a local temporary disk, and optional data disks. Data disks are the recommended way to store data for a virtual machine. For details, see [About Disks and VHDs for Virtual Machines](virtual-machines-linux-about-disks-vhds.md). It's not possible to detach an operating system disk unless you also delete the virtual machine.\n\n## Find the disk\n\nBefore you can detach a disk from a virtual machine, you need to find out the LUN number, which is an identifier for the disk to be detached. To do that, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Open Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows and connect to your Azure subscription. See [Connect\n    to Azure from Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-connect.md) for more details.\n\n2.  Make sure you are in Azure Service Management mode, which is the default by typing `azure config\n    mode asm`.\n\n3.  Find out which disks are attached to your virtual machine by using `azure vm disk list\n    <virtual-machine-name>` as follows:\n\n        $azure vm disk list ubuntuVMasm\n        info:    Executing command vm disk list\n        + Fetching disk images\n        + Getting virtual machines\n        + Getting VM disks\n        data:    Lun  Size(GB)  Blob-Name                         OS\n        data:    ---  --------  --------------------------------  -----\n        data:         30        ubuntuVMasm-2645b8030676c8f8.vhd  Linux\n        data:    1    10        test.VHD\n        data:    0    30        ubuntuVMasm-76f7ee1ef0f6dddc.vhd\n        info:    vm disk list command OK\n\n4.  Note the LUN or the **logical unit number** for the disk that you want to detach.\n\n\n## Detach the disk\n\nAfter you find the LUN number of the disk, you're ready to detach it:\n\n1.  Detach the selected disk from the virtual machine by running the command `azure vm disk detach\n    <virtual-machine-name> <LUN>` like this:\n\n        $azure vm disk detach ubuntuVMasm 0\n        info:    Executing command vm disk detach\n        + Getting virtual machines\n        + Removing Data-Disk\n        info:    vm disk detach command OK\n\n2.  You can check if the disk got detached by running this command:\n\n        $azure vm disk list ubuntuVMasm\n        info:    Executing command vm disk list\n        + Fetching disk images\n        + Getting virtual machines\n        + Getting VM disks\n        data:    Lun  Size(GB)  Blob-Name                         OS\n        data:    ---  --------  --------------------------------  -----\n        data:         30        ubuntuVMasm-2645b8030676c8f8.vhd  Linux\n        data:    1    10        test.VHD\n        info:    vm disk list command OK\n\nThe detached disk remains in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.\n"
