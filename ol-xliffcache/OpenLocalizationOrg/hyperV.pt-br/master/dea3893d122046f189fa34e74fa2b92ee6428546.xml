If you do not have an account, you can get a [free Azure trial here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] If you don't already have an Azure account but you do have a subscription to MSDN subscription, you can get free Azure credits by activating your [MSDN subscriber benefits here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) -- or you can use the free account. Either will work for Azure access.\n\n### Step 1: Verify the Azure CLI version\n\nTo use Azure CLI for imperative commands and ARM templates, you need to have at least version 0.8.17. To verify your version, type `azure --version`. You should see something like:\n\n    $ azure --version\n    0.8.17 (node: 0.10.25)\n\nIf you need to update your version of Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-xplat-cli).\n\n### Step 2: Verify you are using a work or school identity with Azure\n\nYou can only use the ARM command mode if you are using an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj573650.aspx#BKMK_WhatIsAnAzureADTenant) or a [Service Principal Name](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn132633.aspx). (These are also called *organizational ids*.)\n\nTo see if you have one, log in by typing `azure login` and using your work or school username and password when prompted. If you do have one, you should see something like the following:\n\n    $ azure login\n    info:    Executing command login\n    warn:    Please note that currently you can login only via Microsoft organizational account or service principal. For instructions on how to set them up, please read http://aka.ms/Dhf67j.\n    Username: ahmet@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\n    Password: *********\n    |info:    Added subscription Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN\n    info:    Setting subscription Visual Studio Ultimate with MSDN as default\n    info:    Added subscription Azure Free Trial\n    +\n    info:    login command OK\n\nIf you do not see this, you must create a new tenant (or service principal) with your Microsoft account identity. (This is often the case with personal MSDN subscriptions or free trial subscriptions.) To create a work or school id from your Azure account created with a Microsoft id, see [Associate an Azure AD Directory with a new Azure Subscription](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj573650.aspx#BKMK_WhatIsAnAzureADTenant). If you think you should have an organizational id already, you may need to talk with the person who created the account for you.\n\n### Step 3: Choose your Azure subscription\n\nIf you have only one subscription in your Azure account, Azure CLI associates itself with that subscription by default. If you have more than one subscription, you need to select the subscription you want to use by typing `azure account set <subscription id or name> true` where _subscription id or name_ is either the subscription id or the subscription name that you would like to work with in the current session.\n\nYou should see something like the following:\n\n    $ azure account set \"Azure Free Trial\" true\n    info:    Executing command account set\n    info:    Setting subscription to \"Azure Free Trial\" with id \"2lskd82-434-4730-9df9-akd83lsk92sa\".\n    info:    Changes saved\n    info:    account set command OK\n\n### Step 4: Place your Azure CLI in the ARM mode\n\nTo use the Azure Resource Management (ARM) mode with the Azure CLI, type `azure config mode arm`. You should see something like the following:\n\n    $ azure config mode arm\n    info:    New mode is arm\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE] You can switch back to use Azure service management commands by typing `azure config mode asm`.\n"
