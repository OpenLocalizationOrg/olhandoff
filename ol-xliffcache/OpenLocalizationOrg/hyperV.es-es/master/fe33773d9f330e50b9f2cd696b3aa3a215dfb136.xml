Both of these are volume-level encryption solutions. This article deals with the specifics of setting up backup for such Azure VMs, and the impact on restore workflows because of encrypted data.\n\n## How backup works\n\nThe overall solution consists of two layers - the VM layer and the Storage layer.\n\n1. The VM layer deals with the data as seen by the guest operating system and the applications running in the virtual machine. It is also the layer that runs the encryption software (Bitlocker or dmcrypt), transparently encrypting data on the volumes before writing it to the disks.\n2. The Storage layer deals with the page blobs and the disks attached to the VM. It has no knowledge of the data being written to the disk, and whether it is encrypted or not. This is the layer at which the VM backup functionality operates.\n\n![How Bitlocker encryption and Azure VM backup coexist](./media/backup-azure-vms-encryption/how-it-works.png)\n\nThe entire encryption of data happens transparently and seamlessly in the VM layer. Thus the data written to the page blobs attached to the VM is encrypted data. When [Azure Backup takes a snapshot of the VMâ€™s disks and transfers data](backup-azure-vms-introduction.md#how-does-azure-back-up-virtual-machines), it copies the encrypted data present on the page blobs.\n\n## Solution components\n\nThere are many parts to this solution that need to be configured and managed correctly for this to work:\n\n| Function | Software used | Additional notes |\n| -------- | ------------- | ------- |\n| Encryption | Bitlocker or dmcrypt | Because the encryption happens in a *different* layer when compared to Azure Backup, it doesn't matter what encryption software is used. That said, this experience has been validated with only Bitlocker and dmcrypt.<br><br> In order to encrypt the data, a key is needed. The key also needs to be kept safe to ensure authorized access to data.  |\n| Key management | CloudLink SecureVM<br>or Azure KeyVault | The key is essential to encrypting or decrypting the data.
