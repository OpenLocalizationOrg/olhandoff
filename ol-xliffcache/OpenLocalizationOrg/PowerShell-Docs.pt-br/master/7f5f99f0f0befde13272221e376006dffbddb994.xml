It consists of three primary components:\n\n* [Configurations](configurations.md) are declarative PowerShell scripts which define and configure instances of resources. Upon running the configuration, DSC (and the resources being called by the configuration) will simply “make it so”, ensuring that the system exists in the state laid out by the configuration. DSC configurations are also idempotent: the Local Configuration Manager (LCM) will continue to ensure that machines are configured in whatever state the configuration declares.\n* Resources are the imperative building blocks of DSC which are written to model the various components of a sub-system and implement the control flow of their changing states. They reside within PowerShell modules and can be written to model something as generic as a file or a Windows process or as specific as an IIS server or a VM running in Azure.\n* The Local Configuration Manager (LCM) is the engine by which DSC facilitates the interaction between resources and configurations. The LCM regularly polls the system using the control flow implemented by resources to ensure that the state laid out by a Configuration is maintained. If the system is out of state, the LCM uses more logic inside of the resources to “make it so” according to the Configuration declaration. \n\nDSC also includes a number of new language keywords, cmdlets and tools that allow creation of configurations, help build DSC resources, invoke configurations, and manage the LCM. Many of these cmdlets can be found in Windows 8.1 as part of the PsDesiredStateConfig module (including `Start-DscConfiguration`, `Set-DscLocalConfigurationManager`, and `Get-DscResource`). The xDscResourceDesigner (found in the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/xDSCResourceDesigner/)) is a collection of cmdlets that simplify the development of DSC resources.\n\n## See Also\n* [DSC Configurations](configurations.md)\n* [DSC Resources](resources.md)\n* [Configuring The Local Configuration Manager](metaconfig.md)\n\n"
