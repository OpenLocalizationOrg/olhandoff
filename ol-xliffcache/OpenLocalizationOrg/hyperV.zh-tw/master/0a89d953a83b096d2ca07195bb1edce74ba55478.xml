Azure now supports using either of the following two account methods to sign up:\n\n* **Microsoft accounts** (created by you for personal use) - Provide access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox LIVE, or Office 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. After a Microsoft account is created, it can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure. [Learn more](http://www.microsoft.com/account/default.aspx)\n\n* **Work or school accounts** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) - Provide access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization.
