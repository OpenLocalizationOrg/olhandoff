For connecting to additional AD forests, use the installation wizard. |\n| Properties | Used for domain and OU filtering. |\n| Delete | Used to either delete the data in the connector space or to delete connection to a forest. |\n| Configure Run Profiles | With the exception of domain filtering, nothing to configure here. |\n| Run | Used to start a one-off run of a profile. |\n| Stop | Stops a Connector currently running a profile. |\n| Export Connector | Do not use. |\n| Import Connector | Do not use. |\n| Update Connector | Do not use. |\n| Refresh Schema | Refreshes the cached schema. It is preferred to use the option in the installation wizard instead since that will also update sync rules.\n| Search Connector Space | Used to find objects and to [Follow an object and its data through the system](#follow-an-object-and-its-data-through-the-system). |\n\n### Delete\nThe delete action is used for two different things.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/connectordelete.png)\n\nThe option **Delete connector space only** will remove all data, but keep all configuration.\n\nThe option **Delete Connector and connector space** will remove the data as well as all configuration. This is used when you do not want to connect to a forest anymore.\n\nBoth options will sync all objects and update the metaverse objects. This is a long running operation.\n\n### Search Connector Space\nThe search connector space action is useful to find objects and troubleshoot data issues.\n\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cssearch.png)\n\nStart by selecting a **scope**. You can search based on data (RDN, DN, Anchor, Sub-Tree), or state of the object (all other options).  \n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cssearchscope.png)  \nIf you for example do a Sub-Tree search you get all objects in one OU.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cssearchsubtree.png)\nFrom this you can select an object, select **properties** and [follow it](#follow-an-object-and-its-data-through-the-system) from the source connector space, through the metaverse, and to the target connector space.\n\n## Follow an object and its data through the system\nWhen you are troubleshooting a problem with data, follow an object from the source connector space, to the metaverse, and to the target connector space is a key procedure to understand why data does not have the expected values.\n\n### Connector Space Object Properties\n**Import**  \nWhen you open a cs object, there are several tabs at the top. The **Import** tab shows the data which is staged after an import.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/csimport.png)\nThe **Old Value** shows what currently is stored in the system and the **New Value** what has been received from the source system and has not been applied yet. In this case since there is a synchronization error, the change cannot be applied.\n\n**Error**  \nThe error page is only visible if there is a problem with the object. See the details on the operations page for more information on how to [troubleshoot synchronization errors](active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui-operations.md#troubleshoot-errors-in-operations-tab).\n\n**Lineage**  \nThe lineage tab shows how the connector space object is related to the metaverse object. We can see when we last imported a change from the connected system and which rules applied to populate data in the metaverse.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cslineage.png)\nIn the **Action** column we can see there is one **Inbound** sync rule with the action **Provision**. That indicates that as long as this connector space object is present, the metaverse object will remain. If the list of sync rules instead shows a sync rule with direction **Outbound** and **Provision** it indicates that this object will be deleted when the metaverse object is deleted.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cslineageout.png)\nWe can also see in the **PasswordSync** column that the inbound connector space can contribute changes to the password since one sync rule has the value **True**. This password is then sent to Azure AD through the outbound rule.\n\nFrom the lineage tab you can get to the metaverse by clicking on [Metaverse Object Properties](#metaverse-object-properties).\n\nAt the bottom of all tabs are two buttons: **Preview** and **Log**.\n\n**Preview**  \nThe preview page is used to synchronize one single object. It is useful if you are troubleshooting some customer sync rules and want to see the effect of a change on a single object. You can select between **Full Sync** and **Delta sync**. You can also select between **Generate Preview**, which will only keep the change in memory, and **Commit Preview**, which will stage all changes to target connector spaces.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/preview1.png)\nYou can inspect the object and which rule applied for a particular attribute flow.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/preview2.png)\n\n**Log**  \nThe Log page is used to see the password sync status and history, see [Troubleshoot password synchronization](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md#troubleshoot-password-synchronization) for more information.\n\n### Metaverse Object Properties\n**Attributes**  \nOn the attributes tab you can see the values and which Connector contributed it.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/mvattributes.png)\n**Connectors**  \nThe Connectors tab shows all connector spaces which have a representation of the object.\n![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/mvconnectors.png)\nThis tab also allows you to navigate to the [connector space object](#connector-space-object-properties).\n\n## Next steps\nLearn more about the [Azure AD Connect sync](active-directory-aadconnectsync-whatis.md) configuration.\n\nLearn more about [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-aadconnect.md).\n"
