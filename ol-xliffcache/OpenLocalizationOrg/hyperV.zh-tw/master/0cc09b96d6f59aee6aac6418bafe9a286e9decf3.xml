Create the virtual network in the [Azure portal](../articles/virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-classic-pportal.md).\n2.  Create the set of cloud services for your deployment to reflect your design for availability sets and load balancing. In the Azure classic portal, click **New > Compute > Cloud Service > Custom Create** for each cloud service.\n3.  To create each new virtual machine, click **New > Compute > Virtual Machine > From Gallery**. Choose the correct cloud service and virtual network for the VM.
