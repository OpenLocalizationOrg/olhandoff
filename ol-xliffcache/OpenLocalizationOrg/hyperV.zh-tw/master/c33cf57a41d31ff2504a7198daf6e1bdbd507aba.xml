To do so, you must deploy the device registration software package to your Windows 7 domain joined devices using a software distribution system such as System Center Configuration Manager. Be sure to read through and complete the prerequisites listed in Automatic Device Registration with Azure Active Directory for Windows Domain-Joined Devices.\n\n##Installing the device registration software package on Windows 7 domain joined devices\n\nDevice registration for Windows 7 is available as a [downloadable MSI package](https://connect.microsoft.com/site1164). The package must be installed on Windows 7 machines that are joined to an Active Directory Domain. You should deploy the package using a software distribution system such as System Center Configuration Manager. The MSI package supports the standard silent install options using the /quiet parameter.\nThe software package is available for download at the [Microsoft Connect website](https://connect.microsoft.com/site1164). Here you can select and then download Workplace Join for Windows 7.\n\n![](./media/active-directory-conditional-access/device-registration-process-windows7.gif)\n\n## Workplace Join with Azure Active Directory\nDevice registration for Windows 7 domain joined devices does not require or include a user interface. Once installed on the machine, any domain user that logs into the machine will be automatically and silently registered with a device object in Azure AD. There will be one device object in Azure AD for every registered user of the physical device.\n\nThe installer creates a Scheduled Task on the system that runs in the userâ€™s context and is triggered on user sign-in. The task silently registers the user and device with Azure AD after the user signs-in is complete. \nThe Scheduled Task can be found in the Task Scheduler Library under **Microsoft** > **Workplace Join**.\nThe task will run and register any and all Active Directory users that sign-in to the machine.\nThe following illustration lists the step-by-step process for automatic device registration.\n\n![](./media/active-directory-conditional-access/automatic-device-registration-windows7.png)\n\n1.

The user is silently authenticated with AD FS using Windows Integrated Authentication.\n1. The Windows 7 PC is registered to the user in Azure AD.\n1. A device object and certificate is created in Azure AD. The object represents the user@device.\n1.
