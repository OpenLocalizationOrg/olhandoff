Supply the following information: \n\n       - IP address for DATA 0 network interface\n       - Subnet mask\n       - Gateway\n       - IP address for Primary DNS server\n       - IP address for Primary NTP server\n \n        > [AZURE.NOTE] You may have to wait for a few minutes for the subnet mask and DNS settings to be applied. \n\n      4.

We recommend that you use two PuTTY sessions to simultaneously connect to both controllers so that you can see when each controller is restarted.\n\n     `Set-CloudPlatform -AzureGovt_US`\n\n    You will see a confirmation message. Accept the default (**Y**).\n\n11. Run the following cmdlet to resume setup:\n\n     `Invoke-HcsSetupWizard`\n\n     ![Resume setup wizard](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-gov-u2/HCS_ResumeSetup-gov-include.png)\n\n    When you resume setup, the wizard will be the Update 2 version. \n\n12. Accept the network settings. You will see a validation message after you accept each setting.\n \n13. For security reasons, the device administrator password expires after the first session, and you will need to change it now. When prompted, provide a device administrator password. A valid device administrator password must be between 8 and 15 characters. The password must contain three of the following: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.\n\n    <br/>![StorSimple register device 5](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-gov-u2/HCS_RegisterYourDevice5_gov-include.png)\n\n14. The final step in the setup wizard registers your device with the StorSimple Manager service. For this, you will need the service registration key that you obtained in [Step 2: Get the service registration key](storsimple-get-service-registration-key-gov.md). After you supply the registration key, you may need to wait for 2-3 minutes before the device is registered.\n\n      > [AZURE.NOTE] You can press Ctrl + C at any time to exit the setup wizard. If you have entered all the network settings (IP address for Data 0, Subnet mask, and Gateway), your entries will be retained.\n\n    ![StorSimple registration progress](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-gov-u2/HCS_RegistrationProgress-gov-include.png)\n\n15. After the device is registered, a Service Data Encryption key will appear. Copy this key and save it in a safe location. **This key will be required with the service registration key to register additional devices with the StorSimple Manager service.** Refer to [StorSimple security](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-security.md) for more information about this key.\n    \n    ![StorSimple register device 7](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-gov-u2/HCS_RegisterYourDevice7_gov-include.png)    \n\n      > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To copy the text from the serial console window, simply select the text. You should then be able to paste it in the clipboard or any text editor. \n      > \n      > DO NOT use Ctrl + C to copy the service data encryption key. Using Ctrl + C will cause you to exit the setup wizard. As a result, the device administrator password will not be changed and the device will revert to the default password.\n\n16. Exit the serial console.\n\n17. Return to the Azure Government Portal, and complete the following steps:\n  1. Double-click your StorSimple Manager service to access the **Quick Start** page.\n  2. Click **View connected devices**.\n  3. On the **Devices** page, verify that the device has successfully connected to the service by looking up the status. The device status should be **Online**.\n   \n        ![StorSimple Devices page](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-gov-u2/HCS_DeviceOnline-gov-include.png) \n  \n        If the device status is **Offline**, wait for a couple of minutes for the device to come online. \n\n        If the device is still offline after a few minutes, then you need to make sure that your firewall network was configured as described in [networking requirements for your StorSimple device](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-system-requirements.md). \n\n        Verify that port 9354 is open for outbound communication as this is used by the service bus for StorSimple Manager Service-to-device communication.\n     \n        \n"
