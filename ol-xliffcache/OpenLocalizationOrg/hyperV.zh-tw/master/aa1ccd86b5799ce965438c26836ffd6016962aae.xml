Most problems you may run into can be solved with a few simple troubleshooting steps which you can read about below to troubleshoot your deployment:\n\n* [**Information to include when you need help**](#information-to-include-when-you-need-help)\n* [**Problems with Password Management configuration in the Azure Management Portal**](#troubleshoot-password-reset-configuration-in-the-azure-management-portal)\n* [**Problems with Password Managment reports in the Azure Management Portal**](#troubleshoot-password-management-reports-in-the-azure-management-portal)\n* [**Problems with the Password Reset Registration Portal**](#troubleshoot-the-password-reset-registration-portal)\n* [**Problems with the Password Reset Portal**](#troubleshoot-the-password-reset-portal)\n* [**Problems with Password Writeback**](#troubleshoot-password-writeback)\n  - [Password Writeback event log error codes](#password-writeback-event-log-error-codes)\n  - [Problems with Password Writeback connectivity](#troubleshoot-password-writeback-connectivity)\n\nIf you've tried the troubleshooting steps below and are still running into problems, you can post a question on the [Azure AD Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=WindowsAzureAD) or contact support and we'll take a look at your problem as soon as we can.\n\n## Information to include when you need help\n\nIf you cannot solve your issue with the guidance below, you can contact our support engineers. When you contact them, it is recommended to include the following information:\n\n - **General description of the error** – what exact error message did the user see?  If there was no error message, describe the unexpected behavior you noticed, in detail.\n - **Page** – what page were you on when you saw the error (include the URL)?\n - **Date / Time / Timezone** – what was the precise date and time you saw the error (include the timezone)?\n - **Support Code** – what was the support code generated when the user saw the error (to find this, reproduce the error, then click the Support Code link at the bottom of the screen and send the support engineer the GUID that results). \n   - If you are on a page without a support code at the bottom, press F12 and search for SID and CID and send those two results to the support engineer.\n\n    ![][001]\n\n - **User ID** – what was the ID of the user who saw the error (e.g. user@contoso.com)?\n - **Information about the user** – was the user federated, password hash synced, cloud only?

As an administrator, click **Start** on the server running **Azure AD Connect**.\n 2. Type **“services.msc”** in the search box and press **Enter**.\n 3. Look for the **Microsoft Azure AD Connect** entry.\n 4. Right-click on the service entry, click **Restart**, and wait for the operation to complete.\n\n    ![][002]\n\nThese steps will re-establish your connection with the cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing.  If restarting the Sync Service does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try to disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature as a next step.\n\n### Disable and re-enable the Password Writeback feature\nDisabling and re-enabling the Password Writeback feature can help to resolve connectivity issues.\n\n 1. As an administrator, open the **Azure AD Connect configuration wizard**.\n 2. On the **Connect to Azure AD** dialog, enter your **Azure AD global admin credentials**\n 3. On the **Connect to AD DS** dialog, enter your **AD Domain Services admin credentials**.\n 4. On the **Uniquely identifying your users** dialog, click the **Next** button.\n 5. On the **Optional features** dialog, uncheck the **Password write-back** checkbox.\n\n    ![][003]\n\n 6. Click **Next** through the remaining dialog pages without changing anything until you get to the **Ready to configure** page.\n 7. Ensure that the configure page shows the **Password write-back option as disabled** and then click the green **Configure** button to commit your changes.\n 8. On the **Finished** dialog, deselect the **Synchronize now** option, and then click **Finish** to close the wizard.\n 9. Re-open the **Azure AD Connect configuration wizard**.\n 10.    **Repeat steps 2-8**, except ensure you **check the Password write-back option** on the **Optional features** screen to re-enable the service.\n\n    ![][004]\n\nThese steps will re-establish your connection with our cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing. \n\nIf disabling and re-enabling the Password Writeback feature does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try to re-install Azure AD Connect as a next step.\n\n### Install the latest Azure AD Connect release\nRe-installing the Azure AD Connect package will resolve any configuration issues which may be affecting your ability to either connect to our cloud services or to manage passwords in your local AD environment. \nWe recommend, you perform this step only after attempting the first two steps described above.\n\n 1. Download the latest version of Azure AD Connect [here](active-directory-aadconnect.md#download-azure-ad-connect).\n 2. Since you have already installed Azure AD Connect, you will only need to perform an in-place upgrade to update your Azure AD Connect installation to the latest version.\n 3. Execute the downloaded package and follow the on-screen instructions to update your Azure AD Connect machine.  No additional manual steps are required unless you have customized the out of box sync rules, in which case you should **back these up before proceeding with upgrade and manually re-deploy them after you are finished**.\n\nThese steps will re-establish your connection with our cloud service and resolve any interruptions you may be experiencing. \n\nIf installing the latest version of the Azure AD Connect server does not resolve your issue, we recommend that you try disabling and re-enabling Password Writeback as a final step after installing the latest sync QFE. \n\nIf that does not resolve your issue, then we recommend that you take a look at [Troubleshoot Password Writeback](#troubleshoot-password-writeback) and the [Azure AD password Management FAQ](active-directory-passwords-faq.md) to see if your issue may be discussed there.\n\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n## Links to password reset documentation\nBelow are links to all of the Azure AD Password Reset documentation pages: \n\n* [**Reset your own password**](active-directory-passwords-update-your-own-password.md) - learn about how to reset or change your own password as a user of the system\n* [**How it works**](active-directory-passwords-how-it-works.md) - learn about the six different components of the service and what each does\n* [**Getting started**](active-directory-passwords-getting-started.md) - learn how to allow you users to reset and change their cloud or on-premises passwords\n* [**Customize**](active-directory-passwords-customize.md) - learn how to customize the look & feel and behavior of the service to your organization's needs\n* [**Best practices**](active-directory-passwords-best-practices.md) - learn how to quickly deploy and effectively manage passwords in your organization\n* [**Get insights**](active-directory-passwords-get-insights.md) - learn about our integrated reporting capabilities\n* [**FAQ**](active-directory-passwords-faq.md) - get answers to frequently asked questions\n* [**Learn more**](active-directory-passwords-learn-more.md) - go deep into the technical details of how the service works\n\n\n\n[001]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/001.jpg \"Image_001.jpg\"\n[002]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/002.jpg \"Image_002.jpg\"\n[003]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/003.jpg \"Image_003.jpg\"\n[004]: ./media/active-directory-passwords-troubleshoot/004.jpg \"Image_004.jpg\"\n\n\n\n"
