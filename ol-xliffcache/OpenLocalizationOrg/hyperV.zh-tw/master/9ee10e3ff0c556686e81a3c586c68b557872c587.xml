This feature is enabled by default for express installations and will make sure that when a new version is released, your installation is automatically upgraded.\n\nAutomatic upgrade is enabled by default for the following:\n\n- Express settings installation\n- Using SQL Express LocalDB , which is what Express settings will always use\n- The AD account is the default MSOL_ account created by Express settings\n- Have less than 100,000 objects in the metaverse\n\nThe current state of automatic upgrade can be viewed with the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-ADSyncAutoUpgrade`. It has the following states:\n\n| State | Comment |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| Enabled | Automatic upgrade is enabled. |\n| Suspended | Set by the system only. The system is no longer eligible to receive automatic upgrades. |\n| Disabled | Automatic upgrade is disabled. |\n\nYou can change between **Enabled** and **Disabled** with `Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade`. Only the system should set the state **Suspended**.\n\nAutomatic upgrade is using Azure AD Connect Health as the upgrade infrastructure. For automatic upgrade to correctly work, make sure you have opened the URLs in the proxy for **Azure AD Connect Health** as documented in [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges ](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).\n\nIf the **Synchronization Service Manager** UI is running on the server, then the upgrade will be suspended until the UI is closed.\n\n## Next steps\nLearn more about [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-aadconnect.md).\n"
