In the search box of the Microsoft Update Catalog, enter the Knowledge Base (KB) number of the hotfix you want to download, for example **3121901**, and then click **Search**.\n\n    The hotfix listing appears, for example, **Cumulative Software Bundle Update 2.0 for StorSimple 8000 Series**.\n\n    ![Search catalog](./media/storsimple-install-update2-hotfix/HCS_SearchCatalog1-include.png)\n\n4. Click **Add**. The update is added to the basket.\n\n5. Search for any additional hotfixes listed in the table above (**3121900**, **3080728**, **3090322**, and **3121899**), and add each the basket.\n\n5. Click **View Basket**.\n\n6. Click **Download**. Specify or **Browse** to a local location where you want the downloads to appear. The updates are downloaded to the specified location and placed in a subfolder with the same name as the update. The folder can also be copied to a network share that is reachable from the device.\n\n>   [AZURE.NOTE]\nThe hotfixes must be accessible from both controllers to detect any potential error messages from the peer controller.\n\n#### To install and verify regular mode hotfixes\n\nPerform the following steps to install and verify regular-mode hotfixes. If you already installed them using the Azure Portal, skip ahead to [install and verify maintenance mode hotfixes](#to-install-and-verify-maintenance-mode-hotfixes).\n\n1. To install the hotfixes, access the Windows PowerShell interface on your StorSimple device serial console. Follow the detailed instructions in [Use PuTTy to connect to the serial console](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console). At the command prompt, press **Enter**.\n\n4. Select **Option 1** to log on to the device with full access.\n\n5. To install the hotfix, at the command prompt, type:\n\n    `Start-HcsHotfix -Path <path to update file> -Credential <credentials in domain\\username format>`\n\n    Use IP rather than DNS in share path in the above command. The credential parameter is used only if you are accessing an authenticated share.\n\n    We recommend that you use the credential parameter to access shares. Even shares that are open to “everyone” are typically not open to unauthenticated users.\n\n    A sample output is shown below.\n\n        ````\n        Controller0>Start-HcsHotfix -Path \\\\10.100.100.100\\share\n        \\hcsmdssoftwareupdate.exe -Credential contoso\\John\n\n        Confirm\n\n        This operation starts the hotfix installation and could reboot one or\n        both of the controllers. If the device is serving I/Os, these will not\n        be disrupted. Are you sure you want to continue?\n        [Y] Yes [N] No [?] Help (default is \"Y\"): Y\n\n        ````\n\n6. Type **Y** when prompted to confirm the hotfix installation.\n\n7. Monitor the update by using the `Get-HcsUpdateStatus` cmdlet.\n\n    The following sample output shows the update in progress. The `RunInprogress` will be `True` when the update is in progress.\n\n        ````\n        Controller0>Get-HcsUpdateStatus\n        RunInprogress       : True\n        LastHotfixTimestamp : 12/21/2015 10:36:13 PM\n        LastUpdateTimestamp : 12/21/2015 10:35:25 PM\n        Controller0Events   :\n        Controller1Events   :\n        ````\n\n     The following sample output indicates that the update is finished. The `RunInProgress` will be `False` when the update has completed.\n\n        ````\n        Controller1>Get-HcsUpdateStatus\n\n        RunInprogress       : False\n        LastHotfixTimestamp : 12/21/2015 10:59:13 PM\n        LastUpdateTimestamp : 12/21/2015 10:35:25 PM\n        Controller0Events   :\n        Controller1Events   :\n\n        ````\n\n    > [AZURE.NOTE] Occasionally, the cmdlet reports `False` when the update is still in progress. To ensure that the hotfix is complete, wait for a few minutes, rerun this command and verify that the `RunInProgress` is `False`. If it is, then the hotfix has completed.\n\n8. After the software update is complete, repeat steps 3-5 to install and monitor the SaaS agent and MDS agent . Ensure that `all-hcsmdssoftwareupdate_0b438ddf0d5b686aada2378b754fac8c7f2160e9.exe` is installed before `all-cismdsagentupdatebundle_f98e62f4d56c79e2a6644d027af7a2393a93827a.exe`.\n\n9. Verify the system software versions. Type:\n\n    `Get-HcsSystem`\n\n    You should see the following versions:\n\n    - HcsSoftwareVersion: 6.3.9600.17673\n    - CisAgentVersion: 1.0.9150.0\n    - MdsAgentVersion: 30.0.4698.13\n\n    If the version numbers do not change after applying the update, it indicates that the hotfix has failed to apply. Should you see this, please contact [Microsoft Support](storsimple-contact-microsoft-support.md) for further assistance.\n\n9. Repeat steps 3-5 to install the remaining regular-mode hotfixes.\n\n    - The LSI driver - KB3121900\n    - The Storport update - KB3080728\n    - The Spaceport update - KB3090322\n\n#### To install and verify maintenance mode hotfixes\n\nUse KB3121899 to install disk firmware updates. These are disruptive updates and take around 30 minutes to complete. You can choose to install these in a planned maintenance window by connecting to the device serial console.\n\nNote that if your disk firmware is already up-to-date, you won't need to install these updates. Run the `Get-HcsUpdateAvailability` cmdlet from the device serial console to check if updates are available and whether the updates are disruptive (maintenance mode) or non-disruptive (regular mode) updates.\n\nTo install the disk firmware updates, follow the instructions below.\n\n1. Place the device in the Maintenance mode. Note that you should not use Windows PowerShell remoting when connecting to a device in Maintenance mode. Instead run this cmdlet on the device controller when connected through the device serial console. Type:\n\n    `Enter-HcsMaintenanceMode`\n\n    A sample output is shown below.\n\n        Controller0>Enter-HcsMaintenanceMode\n        Checking device state...\n\n        In maintenance mode, your device will not service IOs and will be disconnected from the Microsoft Azure StorSimple Manager service. Entering maintenance mode will end the current session and reboot both controllers, which takes a few minutes to complete. Are you sure you want to enter maintenance mode?\n        [Y] Yes [N] No (Default is \"Y\"): Y\n\n        -----------------------MAINTENANCE MODE------------------------\n        Microsoft Azure StorSimple Appliance Model 8100\n        Name: Update2-8100-SHG0997879L76YD\n        Software Version: 6.3.9600.17664\n        Copyright (C) 2014 Microsoft Corporation.

After the disk firmware updates are successfully applied and the device has exited maintenance mode, return to the Azure classic portal. Note that the portal might not show that you installed the Maintenance mode updates for 24 hours.\n"
