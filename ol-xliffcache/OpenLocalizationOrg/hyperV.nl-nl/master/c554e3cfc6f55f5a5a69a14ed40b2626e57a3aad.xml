The `RunInprogress` will be `True` when the update is in progress.\n\n        ````\n        Controller0>Get-HcsUpdateStatus\n        RunInprogress       : True\n        LastHotfixTimestamp : 9/02/2015 10:36:13 PM\n        LastUpdateTimestamp : 9/02/2015 10:35:25 PM\n        Controller0Events   :\n        Controller1Events   :\n        ````\n\n     The following sample output indicates that the update is finished.

After the software update is complete, verify the system software versions. Type the following command:\n\n    `Get-HcsSystem`\n\n    You should see the following versions:\n\n    - HcsSoftwareVersion: 6.3.9600.17584\n    - CisAgentVersion: 1.0.9049.0\n    - MdsAgentVersion: 26.0.4696.1433\n\n    If the version numbers do not change after applying the update, it indicates that the hotfix has failed to apply. Should you see this, please contact [Microsoft Support](storsimple-contact-microsoft-support.md) for further assistance.\n\n9. Repeat steps 3-5 to install the remaining regular-mode hotfix (KB3043005).\n\n#### To install and verify maintenance mode hotfixes\n\nUse KB3063416 to install disk firmware updates. These are disruptive updates and take around 30-45 minutes to complete. You can choose to install these in a planned maintenance window by connecting to the device serial console.\n\nTo install the disk firmware updates, follow the instructions below.\n\n1. Place the device in Maintenance mode. Note that you should not use Windows PowerShell remoting when connecting to a device in Maintenance mode. You will need to run this cmdlet on the device controller when connected through the device serial console. Type:\n\n    `Enter-HcsMaintenanceMode`\n\n    A sample output is shown below.\n\n        Controller0>Enter-HcsMaintenanceMode\n        Checking device state...\n\n        In maintenance mode, your device will not service IOs and will be disconnected from the Microsoft Azure StorSimple Manager service. Entering maintenance mode will end the current session and reboot both controllers, which takes a few minutes to complete. Are you sure you want to enter maintenance mode?\n        [Y] Yes [N] No (Default is \"Y\"): Y\n\n        -----------------------MAINTENANCE MODE------------------------\n        Microsoft Azure StorSimple Appliance Model 8100\n        Name: Update1-8100-SHG0997879L76YD\n        Software Version: 6.3.9600.17584\n        Copyright (C) 2014 Microsoft Corporation.

To install the disk firmware update, type:\n\n    `Start-HcsHotfix -Path <path to update file> -Credential <credentials in domain\\username format>`\n\n    A sample output is shown below.\n\n        Controller1>Start-HcsHotfix -Path \\\\10.100.100.100\\share\\DiskFirmwarePackage.exe -Credential contoso\\john\n        Enter Password:\n        WARNING: In maintenance mode, hotfixes should be installed on each controller sequentially. After the hotfix is installed on this controller, install it on the peer controller.\n        Confirm\n        This operation starts a hotfix installation and could reboot one or both of the controllers. Are you sure you want to continue?\n        [Y] Yes [N] No (Default is \"Y\"): Y\n        WARNING: Installation is currently in progress. This operation can take several minutes to complete.\n\n1.  Monitor the install progress using `Get-HcsUpdateStatus` command. The update is complete when the `RunInProgress` changes to `False`.\n\n2.  After the installation is complete, the controller on which the maintenance mode hotfix was installed will be rebooted. Log in as option 1 with full access and verify the disk firmware version. Type:\n\n    `Get-HcsFirmwareVersion`\n\n    The expected disk firmware versions are:\n\n    `XMGG, XGEE, KZ50, F6C2, VR08`\n\n    Run the `Get-HcsFirmwareVersion` command on the second controller to verify that the software version has been updated. You can then exit the maintenance mode. Type the following command for each device controller:\n\n    `Exit-HcsMaintenanceMode`\n\n1. The controllers restart when you exit Maintenance mode. After the disk firmware updates are successfully applied and the device has exited maintenance mode, return to the Azure classic portal. Note that the portal might not show that you installed the Maintenance mode updates for 24 hours.\n"
