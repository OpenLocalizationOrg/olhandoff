It is easy to see why administrators would have concerns about unauthorized access to corporate data, possible data leakage and other security risks. This lack of awareness can make creating a plan for dealing with these security risks seem daunting.\n\nCloud App Discovery is a feature of Azure Active Directory (AD) Premium that enables you to discover cloud applications being used by the people in your organization.\n\n**With Cloud App Discovery, you can:**\n\n- Find the cloud applications being used and measure that usage by number of users, volume of traffic or number of web requests to the application.\n- Identify the users that are using an application.\n- Export data for offline analysis.\n- Bring these applications under IT control and enable single sign on for user management.\n\n## How it works\n1. Application usage agents are installed on user's computers.\n2. The application usage information captured by the agents is sent over a secure, encrypted channel to the cloud app discovery service.\n3. The Cloud App Discovery service evaluates the data and generates reports.\n\n![Cloud App Discovery diagram](./media/active-directory-cloudappdiscovery/cad01.png)\n\nTo get started with Cloud App Discovery, see [Getting Started With Cloud App Discovery](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30962.getting-started-with-cloud-app-discovery.aspx)\n\n## Related articles\n- [Cloud App Discovery Security and Privacy Considerations](active-directory-cloudappdiscovery-security-and-privacy-considerations.md)  \n- [Cloud App Discovery Group Policy Deployment Guide](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30965.cloud-app-discovery-group-policy-deployment-guide.aspx)\n- [Cloud App Discovery System Center Deployment Guide](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30968.cloud-app-discovery-system-center-deployment-guide.aspx)\n- [Cloud App Discovery Registry Settings for Proxy Servers with Custom Ports](active-directory-cloudappdiscovery-registry-settings-for-proxy-services.md)\n- [Cloud App Discovery Agent Changelog ](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/24616.cloud-app-discovery-agent-changelog.aspx)\n- [Cloud App Discovery Frequently Asked Questions](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/24037.cloud-app-discovery-frequently-asked-questions.aspx)\n\n\n"
