To enable Application Proxy to work with these redirects, the following steps need to be taken.\n\n> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Application Proxy is a feature that is available only if you upgraded to the Premium or Basic edition of Azure Active Directory. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](active-directory-editions.md).\n\n\n## Prerequisite\n\nBefore performing this procedure, make sure that the STS the claims aware app redirects to is available outside of your on-premises network.\n\n\n### Azure classic portal configuration\n\n1. Publish your application according to the instructions described in [Publish applications with Application Proxy](active-directory-application-proxy-publish.md).\n2. In the list of applications, select the claims aware app and click **Configure**.\n3. If you chose **Passthrough** as your **Preauthentication Method**, make sure to select **HTTPS** as your **External URL** scheme.\n4. If you chose **Azure Active Directory** as your **Preauthentication Method**, select **None** as your **Internal Authentication Method**.\n\n\n### ADFS configuration\n\n1. Open ADFS Management.\n2. Go to **Relying Party Trusts**, right click on the app you are publishing with Application Proxy, and choose **Properties**.\n\n![Relying Party Trusts right click on app name - screentshot](./media/active-directory-application-proxy-claims-aware-apps/appproxyrelyingpartytrust.png)\n\n3. On the **Endpoints** tab, under **Endpoint type** select **WS-Federation**.\n4. Under **Trusted URL**, enter the URL you entered in the Application Proxy under **External URL** and click **OK**.\n\n![Add an Endpoint - set Trusted URL value - screenshot](./media/active-directory-application-proxy-claims-aware-apps/appproxyendpointtrustedurl.png)\n\n\n"
