This replaces the App Service gateway for most applications. If using the gateway, please see the [alternative method]. Differences that apply to using the gateway are called out in notes throughout that section.\n\n\n## <a name=\"express\"> </a>Configure Azure Active Directory using express settings\n\n13. In the [Azure portal], navigate to your application. Click **Settings**, and then **Authentication/Authorization**.\n\n14. If the Authentication / Authorization feature is not enabled, turn the switch to **On**.\n\n15. Click **Azure Active Directory**, and then click **Express** under **Management Mode**.\n\n16. Click **OK** to register the application in Azure Active Directory. This will create a new registration. If you wish to choose an existing registration instead, click **Select an existing app** and then search for the name of a previously created registration within your tenant. Click the registration to select it and click **OK**. Then click **OK** on the Azure Active Directory settings blade.\n\n    ![][0]\n    \n    By default, App Service provides authentication but does not restrict authorized access to your site content and APIs. You must authorize users in your app code. \n\n17. (Optional) To restrict access to your site to only users authenticated by Azure Active Directory, set **Action to take when request is not authenticated** to **Azure Active Directory**. This requires that all requests be authenticated, and all unauthenticated requests are redirected to Azure Active Directory for authentication.\n\n17. Click **Save**. \n\nYou are now ready to use Azure Active Directory for authentication in your app.\n\n## <a name=\"advanced\"> </a>(Alternative method) Manually configure Azure Active Directory with advanced settings\nYou can also choose to provide configuration settings manually. This is the preferred solution if the AAD tenant you wish to use is different from the tenant with which you sign into Azure. To complete the configuration, you must first create a registration in Azure Active Directory, and then you must provide some of the registration details to App Service.\n\n### <a name=\"register\"> </a>Register your application with Azure Active Directory\n\n1. Log on to the [Azure portal], and navigate to your application. Copy your **URL**. You will use this to configure your Azure Active Directory app.\n\n3. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal] and navigate to **Active Directory**.\n\n    ![][2] \n\n4. Select your directory, and then select the **Applications** tab at the top. Click **ADD** at the bottom to create a new app registration. \n\n5. Click **Add an application my organization is developing**.\n\n6. In the Add Application Wizard, enter a **Name** for your application and click the  **Web Application And/Or Web API** type. Then click to continue.\n\n7. In the **SIGN-ON URL** box, paste the application URL you copied earlier. Enter that same URL in the **App ID URI** box. Then click to continue.\n\n8. Once the application has been added, click the **Configure** tab. Edit the **Reply URL** under **Single Sign-on** to be the the URL of your application appended with the path, _/.auth/login/aad/callback_. For example, `https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback`. Make sure that you are using the HTTPS scheme.\n\n    ![][3]\n    \n    \n    > [AZURE.NOTE]\n    If you are using the App Service Gateway instead of the App Service Authentication / Authorization feature, your Reply URL instead uses the gateway URL with the _/signin-aad_ path.\n\n\n9. Click **Save**. Then copy the **Client ID** for the app. You will configure your application to use this later.\n\n10. In the bottom command bar, click **View Endpoints**, and then copy the **Federation Metadata Document** URL and download that document or navigate to it in a browser.\n\n11. Within the root **EntityDescriptor** element, there should be an **entityID** attribute of the form `https://sts.windows.net/` followed by a GUID specific to your tenant (called a \"tenant ID\"). Copy this value - it will serve as your **Issuer URL**. You will configure your application to use this later.\n\n### <a name=\"secrets\"> </a>Add Azure Active Directory information to your application\n\n> [AZURE.NOTE]\nIf using the App Service Gateway, ignore this section and instead navigate to your gateway in the portal. Select **Settings**, **Identity**, and then **Azure Active Directory**. Paste in the ClientID and add the tenant ID to the **Allowed Tenants** list. Click **Save**.\n\n\n13. Back in the [Azure portal], navigate to your application. Click **Settings**, and then **Authentication/Authorization**.\n\n14. If the Authentication/Authorization feature is not enabled, turn the switch to **On**.\n\n15. Click **Azure Active Directory**, and then click **Advanced** under **Management Mode**. Paste in the Client ID and Issuer URL value which you obtained previously. Then click **OK**.\n\n    ![][1]\n    \n    By default, App Service provides authentication but does not restrict authorized access to your site content and APIs. You must authorize users in your app code. \n\n17. (Optional) To restrict access to your site to only users authenticated by Azure Active Directory, set **Action to take when request is not authenticated** to **Azure Active Directory**. This requires that all requests be authenticated, and all unauthenticated requests are redirected to Azure Active Directory for authentication.\n\n17. Click **Save**. \n\nYou are now ready to use Azure Active Directory for authentication in your app. \n\n## (Optional) Configure a native client application\n\nAzure Active Directory also allows you to register native clients, which provides greater control over permissions mapping. You need this if you wish to perform logins using a library such as the **Active Directory Authentication Library**.\n\n1. Navigate to **Active Directory** in the [Azure classic portal].\n\n2. Select your directory, and then select the **Applications** tab at the top. Click **ADD** at the bottom to create a new app registration. \n\n3. Click **Add an application my organization is developing**.\n\n4. In the Add Application Wizard, enter a **Name** for your application and click the  **Native Client Application** type. Then click to continue.\n\n5. In the **Redirect URI** box, enter your site's _/.auth/login/done_ endpoint, using the HTTPS scheme. This value should be similar to _https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/done_.\n\n6. Once the native application has been added, click the **Configure** tab. Find the **Client ID** and make a note of this value.\n\n7. Scroll the page down to the **Permissions to other applications** section and click **Add application**.\n\n8. Search for the web application that you registered earlier and click the plus icon. Then click the check to close the dialog.\n\n9. On the new entry you just added, open the **Delegated Permissions** dropdown and select **Access (appName)**. Then click **Save**.\n\nYou have now configured a native client application which can access your App Service application.\n\n## <a name=\"related-content\"> </a>Related Content\n\n[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-related-content-get-started-users](../../includes/app-service-mobile-related-content-get-started-users.md)]\n\n<!-- Images. -->\n\n[0]: ./media/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication/mobile-app-aad-express-settings.png\n[1]: ./media/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication/mobile-app-aad-advanced-settings.png\n[2]: ./media/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication/app-service-navigate-aad.png\n[3]: ./media/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication/app-service-aad-app-configure.png\n\n<!-- URLs. -->\n\n[Azure portal]: https://portal.azure.com/\n[Azure classic portal]: https://manage.windowsazure.com/\n[ios-adal]: ../app-service-mobile-xamarin-ios-aad-sso.md\n[alternative method]:#advanced\n\n"
