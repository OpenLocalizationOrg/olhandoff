If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile apps that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).\n\n* [Visual Studio Community 2013] or a later version.\n\n>[AZURE.NOTE] If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](https://tryappservice.azure.com/?appServiceName=mobile).
