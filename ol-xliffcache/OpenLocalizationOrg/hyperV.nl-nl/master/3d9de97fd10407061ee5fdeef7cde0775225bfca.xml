For more information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../articles/powershell-install-configure.md).\n\n### Create an Azure Active Directory\nFirst, you need to have an [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/trial/get-started-active-directory/) (AAD) in your subscription. Among many benefits, this allows you to grant permission to your key vault for certain users and applications.\n\nNext, register an application with AAD.
