Logic apps can trigger based on a variety of data sources and offer connectors to get and process data. You can add the File connector to your business workflow and process data as part of this workflow within a Logic App. \n\nThe File Connector uses the Hybrid Connection Manager for hybrid connectivity to the host file system.\n\n## Creating a File connector for your Logic App ##\nTo use the File connector, you need to first create an instance of the File connector API app. This can be done as follows:\n\n1.  Open the Azure Marketplace using the + NEW option on the left side of the Azure Portal.\n2.  Browse to “Marketplace > API Apps” and search for “File Connector”.\n3.  Configure the File connector as follows:  \n![][1]\n\n    - **Name** - give a name for your File Connector\n    - **Package Settings**\n        - **Root Folder** - Specify the root folder path on your host machine.
