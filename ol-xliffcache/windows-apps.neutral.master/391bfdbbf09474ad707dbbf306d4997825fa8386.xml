The content area is always visible. The pane can expand and collapse or remain in an open state, and can present itself from either the left side or right side of an app window. The pane has four modes:\n\n-   **Overlay**\n\n    The pane is hidden until opened. When open, the pane overlays the content area.\n\n-   **Inline**\n\n    The pane is always visible and doesn't overlay the content area. The pane and content areas divide the available screen real estate.\n\n-   **CompactOverlay**\n\n    A narrow portion of the pane is always visible in this mode, which is just wide enough to show icons. The default closed pane width is 48px, which can be modified with `CompactPaneLength`. If the pane is opened, it will overlay the content area.\n\n-   **CompactInline**\n\n    A narrow portion of the pane is always visible in this mode, which is just wide enough to show icons. The default closed pane width is 48px, which can be modified with `CompactPaneLength`. If the pane is opened, it will reduce the space available for content, pushing the content out of its way.\n\n## <span id=\"Is_this_the_right_control_\"></span><span id=\"is_this_the_right_control_\"></span><span id=\"IS_THIS_THE_RIGHT_CONTROL_\"></span>Is this the right control?\n\nThe split view control can be used to make a [navigation pane](nav-pane.md). To build this pattern, add an expand/collapse button (the \"hamburger\" button) and a list view representing the nav items.\n\nThe split view control can also be used to create any \"drawer\" experience where users can open and close the supplemental pane.\n\n## <span id=\"Examples\"></span><span id=\"examples\"></span><span id=\"EXAMPLES\"></span>Examples\n\nThe split view control in its default form is a basic container.
