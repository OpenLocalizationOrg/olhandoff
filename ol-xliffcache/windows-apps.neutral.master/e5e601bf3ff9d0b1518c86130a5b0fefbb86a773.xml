These usually convey other pieces of information about the icon like status or action. Other commons terms include: overlay, annotation, or modifier. \n\n![Status badge ](images/icons-badge-status.png)\n\n![Action badge ](images/icons-badge-action.png)\n\nStatus badges utilize a filled, colored object that is on top of the icon, whereas action badges are integrated into the icon in the same monochrome style and line weight.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n    <td>Common status badges</td>\n    <td>Common action badges</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n    <td>![Status badge ](images/icons-badge-common-states-1.png)</td>\n    <td>![Action badge ](images/icons-badge-common-states-2.png)</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n\n### Badge color \n\nColor badging should only be used to convey the state of an icon. The colors used in status badging convey specific emotional messages to the user. \n\n<table>\n<tr><td>Green - #128B44</td><td>Blue - #2C71B9</td><td>Yellow - #FDC214</td></tr>\n<tr><td>Positive: done, \ncompleted </td><td>Neutral: help, \nnotification </td><td>Cautionary: alert, warning </td></tr>\n<tr><td>![Green status](images/icons-color-inbadging-1.png)</td><td>![Blue status](images/icons-color-inbadging-2.png)</td>\n<td>![Yellow status](images/icons-color-inbadging-3.png)</td></tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n\n### Badge position\n\nThe default position for any status or action is the bottom right. Only use the other positions when the design will not allow it. \n\n### Badge sizing\n\nBadges should be sized to 10–18 px on a 32 px × 32 px grid. \n\n## Related articles\n\n* [Guidelines for tile and icon assets](../controls-and-patterns/tiles-and-notifications-app-assets.md)\n"}
