This pattern is frequently used for email and contact lists/address books.\ntitle: Master/details\nms.assetid: 45C9FE8B-ECA6-44BF-8DDE-7D12ED34A7F7\nlabel: Master/details\ntemplate: detail.hbs\n---\n# Master/details pattern\n\nThe master/details pattern has a master pane (usually with a [list view](lists.md)) and a details pane for content. When an item in the master list is selected, the details pane is updated. This pattern is frequently used for email and address books.\n\n![Example of master-details pattern](images/HIGSecOne_MasterDetail.png)\n\n## Is this the right pattern?\n\nThe master/details pattern works well if you want to:\n\n-   Build an email app, address book, or any app that is based on a list-details layout.\n-   Locate and prioritize a large collection of content.\n-   Allow the quick addition and removal of items from a list while working back-and-forth between contexts.\n\n## Choose the right style\n\nWhen implementing the master/details pattern, we recommend that you use either the stacked style or the side-by-side style, based on the amount of available screen space.\n\n| Available window width | Recommended style |\n|------------------------|-------------------|\n| 320 epx-719 epx        | Stacked           |\n| 720 epx or wider       | Side-by-side      |\n\n \n## Stacked style\n\nIn the stacked style, only one pane is visible at a time: the master or the details.\n\n![A master detail in stacked mode](images/patterns-md-stacked.png)\n\nThe user starts at the master pane and \"drills down\" to the details pane by selecting an item in the master list. To the user, it appears as though the master and details views exist on two separate pages.\n\n### Create a stacked master/details pattern\n\nOne way to create the stacked master/details pattern is to use separate pages for the master pane and the details pane. Place the list view that provides the master list on one page, and the content element for the details pane on a separate page.\n\n![Parts for the stacked-style master detail](images/patterns-md-stacked-parts.png)\n\nFor the master pane, a [list view](lists.md) control works well for presenting lists that can contain images and text.\n\nFor the details pane, use the content element that makes the most sense. If you have a lot of separate fields, consider using a grid layout to arrange elements into a form.\n\n## Side-by-side style\n\nIn the side-by-side style, the master pane and details pane are visible at the same time.\n\n![The master/detail pattern](images/patterns-masterdetail-400x227.png)\n\nThe list in the master pane has a selection visual to indicate the currently selected item. Selecting a new item in the master list updates the details pane.\n\n### Create a side-by-side master/details pattern\n\nFor the master pane, a [list view](lists.md) control works well for presenting lists that can contain images and text.\n\nFor the details pane, use the content element that makes the most sense.
