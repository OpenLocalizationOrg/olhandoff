each form factor. When designing for a particular device, the main considerations include how the app will appear on that device, where, when, and how the app will be used on that device, and how the user will interact with that device.\n\n## <span id=\"Phones_and_phablets\"></span><span id=\"phones_and_phablets\"></span><span id=\"PHONES_AND_PHABLETS\"></span>Phones and phablets\n\n\nThe most widely-used of all computing devices, phones can do a lot with limited screen real estate and basic inputs. Phones are available in a variety of sizes; larger phones are called phablets. App experiences on phablets are similar to those on phones, but the increased screen real estate of phablets enable some key changes in content consumption.\n\nWith Continuum for Phones, a new experience for compatible Windows 10 mobile devices, users can connect their phones to a monitor and even use a mouse and keyboard to make their phones work like a laptop.
