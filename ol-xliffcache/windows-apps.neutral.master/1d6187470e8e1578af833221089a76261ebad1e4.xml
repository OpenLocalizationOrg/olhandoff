The emulator is a desktop application that emulates a mobile device running Windows 10. It provides a virtualized environment in which you can debug and test Windows apps without a physical device. It also provides an isolated environment for your application prototypes. |\n| [Test Surface Hub apps using Visual Studio](test-surface-hub-apps-using-visual-studio.md) | The Visual Studio simulator provides an environment where you can design, develop, debug, and test Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, including apps that you have built for Microsoft Surface Hub. The simulator does not use the same user interface as Surface Hub, but it is useful for testing how your app looks and behaves at the Surface Hub's screen size and resolution. |\n| [Beta testing](beta-testing.md) | **Beta testing** gives you the chance to improve your app based on feedback from individuals outside of your app-development team who try your unreleased app on their own devices. |\n| [Windows Device Portal](device-portal.md) | The Windows Device Portal lets you configure and manage your device remotely over a network or USB connection. |\n| [Windows App Certification Kit](windows-app-certification-kit.md) | To give your app the best chance of being [Windows App Certification Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=309666). |\n| [Performance](performance-and-xaml-ui.md) | Users expect their apps to remain responsive, to feel natural, and not to drain their battery.

Determine what your performance-critical scenarios are; define what good performance mean. Then measure early and often enough throughout the lifecycle of your project to be confident you'll hit your goals. |\n\n"}
