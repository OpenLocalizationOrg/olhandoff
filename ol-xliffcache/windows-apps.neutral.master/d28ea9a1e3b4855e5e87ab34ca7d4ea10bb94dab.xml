An app that implements app calendars may choose to be activated to show details for appointments in calendars it owns. Otherwise, the system will show the appointment details. An overload of the method that accepts a start date argument is provided to show details for an instance of a recurring appointment.\n\n```cs\nprivate async void ShowAppointmentDetails-Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n\n    if (instanceStartTime == null)\n    {\n        await Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.AppointmentManager.ShowAppointmentDetailsAsync(\n            currentAppointment.LocalId);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Specify a start time to show an instance of a recurring appointment\n        await Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.AppointmentManager.ShowAppointmentDetailsAsync(\n            currentAppointment.LocalId, instanceStartTime);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Summary and next steps\n\nNow you have a basic understanding of how to manage appointments.
