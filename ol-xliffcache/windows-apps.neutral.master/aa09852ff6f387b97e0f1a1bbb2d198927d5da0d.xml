A touchpad combines both indirect multi-touch input with the precision input of a pointing device, such as a mouse. This combination makes the touchpad suited to both a touch-optimized UI and the smaller targets of productivity apps.\n\n \n\n![touchpad](images/input-patterns/input-touchpad.jpg)\n\n\nTouchpad interactions require three things:\n\n-   A standard touchpad or a Windows Precision Touchpad.\n\n    Precision touchpads are optimized for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) devices. They enable the system to handle certain aspects of the touchpad experience natively, such as finger tracking and palm detection, for a more consistent experience across devices.\n\n-   The direct contact of one or more fingers on the touchpad.\n-   Movement of the touch contacts (or lack thereof, based on a time threshold).\n\nThe input data provided by the touchpad sensor can be:\n\n-   Interpreted as a physical gesture for direct manipulation of one or more UI elements (such as panning, rotating, resizing, or moving).

This combination makes the touchpad suited to both touch-optimized UI and the typically smaller targets of productivity apps and the desktop environment. Optimize your Windows Store app design for touch input and get touchpad support by default.\n\nBecause of the convergence of interaction experiences supported by touchpads, we recommend using the [**PointerEntered**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208968) event to provide mouse-style UI commands in addition to the built-in support for touch input.
