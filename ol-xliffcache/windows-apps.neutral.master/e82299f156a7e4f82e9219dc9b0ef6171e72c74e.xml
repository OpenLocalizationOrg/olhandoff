You can view this data in your dashboard, or [download the report](download-analytic-reports.md) to view offline.\n\n> **Important**   This report only shows page view and conversion data from customers on Windows 10.\n\n \n\nIn this report, a *channel* refers to the method in which a customer arrived at your app's listing page (for example, browsing and searching in the Store, a link from an external website, a link from one of your custom campaigns, etc.).

For other channel types, only page view data is currently included in this report.\n\n \n\n## Apply filters\n\n\nNear the top of the page, you can expand **Apply filters** to filter all of the data on this page by date range and/or by market.\n\n-   **Date**: The default filter is **Last 30 days**, but you can expand this up to **Last 12 months**.\n-   **Market**: The default setting is **All markets**. You can choose a specific market if you want this page to only show details from customers in that market.\n-   **Device type**: The default filter is **All devices**. You can choose a specific device type if you want this page to only show data from customers using that type of device.\n\nThe info in all of the charts listed below will reflect the period of time selected in the **Apply filters** section, and will reflect any other filters you've chosen here.\n\n## App page views and conversions by channel\n\n\nThe **App page views and conversions by channel** chart shows how often your app's listing page was viewed and how customers arrived there. It also shows the number of conversions from custom campaigns over the selected period of time.\n\nThe **Page views** tab of this chart shows the number of times your app's listing page was viewed over the selected period of time. Views are grouped according to the type of channel by which the customer found your app's listing.\n\nThe **Conversions** tab of this chart shows the number of conversions (new acquisitions) over the selected period of time for customers who arrived at your app's listing via a custom campaign.\n\n> **Note**  For info about all of your app's acquisitions, including those that did not occur via a custom campaign link and those from customers on other OS versions, see the [Acquisitions report](acquisitions-report.md).\n\n \n\n## Campaign performance by channel\n\n\nThe **Campaign performance by channel** chart shows the number of page views for each channel type. It also shows the total number of app and IAP conversions from your custom campaigns during the selected period of time.\n\n## App page views and conversions by campaign ID\n\n\nThe **App page views and conversions by campaign ID** chart shows the number of page views and conversions for each of your specific [campaign IDs](create-a-custom-app-promotion-campaign.md) during the selected period of time.\n\n##  IAP conversions by campaign ID\n\n\nThe **IAP conversions by campaign ID** chart shows the number of IAP conversions per custom campaign ID.\n\nWhen an app install is counted as a conversion for a custom campaign, any IAP purchases in that app are also counted as conversions for the same custom campaign.\n\nBy default, the report includes any IAP which had a conversion that resulted from a link using a custom campaign ID during the selected period of time. To view data for a specific IAP, select it from the **Section filters**.\n\n## Conversions breakdown\n\n\nThe **Conversions breakdown** chart shows more details about the page views that resulted from each of your channel types.
