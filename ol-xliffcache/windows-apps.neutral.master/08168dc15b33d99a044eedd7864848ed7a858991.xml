After you have read the topics in this section, move on to the [developer walkthroughs](developer-walkthroughs.md) to see examples about how to write the code that will show ads in your apps.\n\nFor complete sample projects that demonstrate how to add banner and video interstitial ads to JavaScript/HTML apps and XAML apps using C# and C++, see the [advertising samples on GitHub](http://aka.ms/githubads).\n\n>**Important**   The Microsoft advertising libraries are a different set of extensions from the ad mediation libraries. Use the [AdControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.adcontrol.aspx) and [InterstitialAd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.interstitialad.aspx) classes in the Microsoft advertising libraries if you want to display banner or video interstitial ads from Microsoft in a XAML or JavaScript app. Use the **AdMediatorControl** class in the ad mediation libraries if you want to display banner ads from multiple ad networks in a XAML app. For more information, see [What is the difference: AdMediatorControl or AdControl](what-is-the-difference-admediatorcontrol-or-adcontrol.md).\n\n \n\n## In this section\n\n| Topic                                                                                                       | Description                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| [Install the Microsoft advertising libraries](install-the-microsoft-advertising-libraries.md) |  Provides installation details and lists the names of the Microsoft advertising libraries and the ad mediation libraries as they appear in the **Reference Manager** dialog box in Visual Studio.  |\n| [What is the difference: AdMediatorControl or AdControl](what-is-the-difference-admediatorcontrol-or-adcontrol.md)        |  Describes the differences between the **AdControl** class in the Microsoft advertising libraries and the **AdMediatorControl** class in the ad mediation libraries.    |\n| [Workflows for creating apps with ads](workflows-for-creating-apps-with-ads.md)     |  Provides high-level steps that describe the process of developing and publishing an app with ads.   |\n| [Release notes](release-notes-for-the-advertising-libraries.md)         |  Provides release notes for the current release of the Microsoft advertising libraries in the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK.   |\n| [Known issues](known-issues-for-the-advertising-libraries.md)      |  Lists the known issues with the current release of the Microsoft advertising libraries in the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK.   |\n| [Additional help](additional-help.md)                                    |   Provides links to more resources about developing apps with ads.  |\n| [Important notice - EULA](important-notice-eula.md)                                    |   Provides details about the end user license agreement (EULA) for the Microsoft advertising libraries.   |\n\n\n \n\n \n"}
