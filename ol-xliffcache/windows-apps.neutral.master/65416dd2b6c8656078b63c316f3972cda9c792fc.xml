It is possible to turn off the default scale factor. This will cause your application to use the actual pixel dimensions of the device (1910 by 1080 pixels).   \n   \n## HTML   \nYou can opt out of scale factor by using the following code snippet: \n   \n`bool result = Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationViewScaling.TrySetDisableLayoutScaling(true);` \n\nOr, you can use a web-friendly method:   \n\n```   \n@media (max-height: 1080px) {   \n    @-ms-viewport {   \n        height: 1080px;   \n    }   \n}   \n```\n\n## XAML\nYou can opt out of scale factor by using the following code snippet:   \n   \n`bool result = Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ApplicationViewScaling.TrySetDisableLayoutScaling(true);`   \n   \n## DirectX/C++   \nDirectX/C++ applications are not scaled. Automatic scaling only applies to HTML and XAML applications.   \n"}
