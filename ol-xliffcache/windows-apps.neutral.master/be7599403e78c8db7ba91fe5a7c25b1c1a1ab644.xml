Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.\\]\n\nUsing the Converter is convenient and automatic, and it's useful if there's any uncertainty about what your installer does. But if your app is installed by using xcopy, or if you're familiar with the changes that your app's installer makes to the system, you can opt to create an app package and manifest manually.\n\nHere are the steps to create a Centennial package manually:\n\n## Create a manifest by hand.\n\nYour _appxmanifest.xml_ file needs to have the following content (at the minimum). Change placeholders that are formatted like \\*\\*\\*THIS\\*\\*\\* to actual values for your application.\n\n    ```XML\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n    <Package\n       xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10\"\n       xmlns:uap=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/uap/windows10\"\n       xmlns:rescap=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/appx/manifest/foundation/windows10/restrictedcapabilities\">\n      <Identity Name=\"***YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE***\"\n        ProcessorArchitecture=\"x64\"\n        Publisher=\"CN=***COMPANY_NAME***, O=***ORGANIZATION_NAME***, L=***CITY***, S=***STATE***, C=***COUNTRY***\"\n        Version=\"***YOUR_PACKAGE_VERSION_HERE***\" />\n      <Properties>\n        <DisplayName>***YOUR_PACKAGE_DISPLAY_NAME_HERE***</DisplayName>\n        <PublisherDisplayName>Reserved</PublisherDisplayName>\n        <Description>No description entered</Description>\n        <Logo>***YOUR_PACKAGE_RELATIVE_DISPLAY_LOGO_PATH_HERE***</Logo>\n      </Properties>\n      <Resources>\n        <Resource Language=\"en-us\" />\n      </Resources>\n      <Dependencies>\n        <TargetDeviceFamily Name=\"Windows.Desktop\" MinVersion=\"10.0.14316.0\" MaxVersionTested=\"10.0.14316.0\" />\n      </Dependencies>\n      <Capabilities>\n        <rescap:Capability Name=\"runFullTrust\"/>\n      </Capabilities>\n      <Applications>\n        <Application Id=\"***YOUR_PRAID_HERE***\" Executable=\"***YOUR_PACKAGE_RELATIVE_EXE_PATH_HERE***\" EntryPoint=\"Windows.FullTrustApplication\">\n          <uap:VisualElements\n           BackgroundColor=\"#464646\"\n           DisplayName=\"***YOUR_APP_DISPLAY_NAME_HERE***\"\n           Square150x150Logo=\"***YOUR_PACKAGE_RELATIVE_PNG_PATH_HERE***\"\n           Square44x44Logo=\"***YOUR_PACKAGE_RELATIVE_PNG_PATH_HERE***\"\n           Description=\"***YOUR_APP_DESCRIPTION_HERE***\" />\n        </Application>\n      </Applications>\n    </Package>\n    ```\n\n## Run the MakeAppX tool\n\nUse the [App packager (MakeAppx.exe)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh446767(v=vs.85).aspx) to generate an AppX for your project. MakeAppx.exe is included with the Windows 10 SDK. \n\nTo run MakeAppx, first ensure you've created an manifest file as described above. \n\nNext, create a mapping file. The file should start with **[Files]**, then list each of your source files on disk followed by their destination path in the package. Here's an example: \n\n```\n[Files]\n\"C:\\MyApp\\StartPage.htm\"     \"default.html\"\n\"C:\\MyApp\\readme.txt\"        \"doc\\readme.txt\"\n\"\\\\MyServer\\path\\icon.png\"   \"icon.png\"\n\"MyCustomManifest.xml\"       \"AppxManifest.xml\"\n```\n\nFinally, run the following command: \n\n```cmd\nMakeAppx.exe pack /f mapping_filepath /p filepath.appx\n```\n\n## Sign your AppX package\n\nThe Add-AppxPackage cmdlet requires that the application package (.appx) being deployed must be signed. Use [SignTool.exe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa387764(v=vs.85).aspx), which ships in the Microsoft Windows 10 SDK, to sign the .appx package.\n\nExample usage: \n\n```cmd\nC:\\> MakeCert.exe -r -h 0 -n \"CN=<publisher_name>\" -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 -pe -sv <my.pvk> <my.cer>\nC:\\> pvk2pfx.exe -pvk <my.pvk> -spc <my.cer> -pfx <my.pfx>\nC:\\> signtool.exe sign -f <my.pfx> -fd SHA256 -v .\\<outputAppX>.appx\n```\n\nWhen you run MakeCert.exe and you're asked to enter a password, select **none**.
