[**Windows.UI.Xaml.Input**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242084)\n\n\n**Important**  \nIf you implement your own interaction support, keep in mind that users expect an intuitive experience involving direct interaction with the UI elements in your app. We recommend that you model your custom interactions on the [Controls list](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185406) to keep things consistent and discoverable. The platform controls provide the full Universal Windows Platform (UWP) user interaction experience, including standard interactions, animated physics effects, visual feedback, and accessibility. Create custom interactions only if there is a clear, well-defined requirement and basic interactions don't support your scenario.\n\n\n## <span id=\"Pointers\"></span><span id=\"pointers\"></span><span id=\"POINTERS\"></span>Pointers\n\n\nMany interaction experiences involve the user identifying the object they want to interact with by pointing at it using input devices such as touch, mouse, pen/stylus, and touchpad. Because the raw Human Interface Device (HID) data provided by these input devices includes many common properties, the info is promoted into a unified input stack and exposed as consolidated, device-agnostic pointer data. Your UWP apps can then consume this data without worrying about the input device being used.\n\n**Note**  Device-specific info is also promoted from the raw HID data should your app require it.\n\n \n\nEach input point (or contact) on the input stack is represented by a [**Pointer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227968) object exposed through the [**PointerRoutedEventArgs**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh943076) parameter provided by various pointer events. In the case of multi-pen or multi-touch input, each contact is treated as a unique input point.\n\n## <span id=\"Pointer_events\"></span><span id=\"pointer_events\"></span><span id=\"POINTER_EVENTS\"></span>Pointer events\n\n\nPointer events expose basic info such as detection state (in range or in contact) and device type, and extended info such as location, pressure, and contact geometry. In addition, specific device properties such as which mouse button a user pressed or whether the pen eraser tip is being used are also available. If your app needs to differentiate between input devices and their capabilities, see [Identify input devices](identify-input-devices.md).\n\nUWP apps can listen for the following pointer events:\n\n**Note**  Call [**CapturePointer**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208918) to constrain pointer input to a specific UI element. When a pointer is captured by an element, only that object receives the pointer input events, even when the pointer moves outside the bounding area of the object. You typically capture the pointer within a [**PointerPressed**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208971) event handler as [**IsInContact**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227976) (mouse button pressed, touch or stylus in contact) must be true for **CapturePointer** to be successful.\n\n \n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Event</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><span id=\"PointerCanceled\"></span><span id=\"pointercanceled\"></span><span id=\"POINTERCANCELED\"></span>[<strong>PointerCanceled</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208964)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Occurs when a pointer is canceled by the platform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Touch pointers are canceled when a pen is detected within range of the input surface.</li>\n<li>An active contact is not detected for more than 100 ms.</li>\n<li>Monitor/display is changed (resolution, settings, multi-mon configuration).</li>\n<li>The desktop is locked or the user has logged off.</li>\n<li>The number of simultaneous contacts exceeded the number supported by the device.</li>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><span id=\"PointerCaptureLost\"></span><span id=\"pointercapturelost\"></span><span id=\"POINTERCAPTURELOST\"></span>[<strong>PointerCaptureLost</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208965)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Occurs when another UI element captures the pointer, the pointer was released, or another pointer was programmatically captured.</p>\n<div class=\"alert\">\n<strong>Note</strong>  There is no corresponding pointer capture event.\n</div>\n<div>\n \n</div></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><span id=\"PointerEntered\"></span><span id=\"pointerentered\"></span><span id=\"POINTERENTERED\"></span>[<strong>PointerEntered</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208968)</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Occurs when a pointer enters the bounding area of an element.
