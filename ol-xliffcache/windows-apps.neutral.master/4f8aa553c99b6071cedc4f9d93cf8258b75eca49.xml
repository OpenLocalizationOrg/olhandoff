For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nProvides a unique identifier for markup elements. For Universal Windows Platform (UWP) XAML, this unique identifier is used by XAML localization processes and tools, such as using resources from a .resw resource file.\n\n## XAML attribute usage\n\n``` syntax\n<object x:Uid=\"stringID\".../>\n```\n\n## XAML values\n\n| Term | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| stringID | A string that uniquely identifies a XAML element in an app, and becomes part of the resource path in a resource file. See Remarks.| \n\n## Remarks\n\nUse **x:Uid** to identify an object element in your XAML. Typically this object element is an instance of a control class or other element that is displayed in a UI. The relationship between the string you use in **x:Uid** and the strings you use in a resources file is that the resource file strings are the **x:Uid** followed by a dot (.) and then by the name of a specific property of the element that's being localized. Consider this example:\n\n``` syntax\n<Button x:Uid=\"GoButton\" Content=\"Go\"/>\n```\n\nTo specify content to replace the display text **Go**, you must specify a new resource that comes from a resource file. Your resource file should contain an entry for the resource named \"GoButton.Content\". [**Content**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209366) in this case is a specific property that's inherited by the [**Button**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209265) class. You might also provide localized values for other properties of this button, for example you could provide a resource-based value for \"GoButton.FlowDirection\". For more info on how to use **x:Uid** and resource files together, see [Quickstart: Translating UI resources](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh965329).\n\nThe validity of which strings can be used for an **x:Uid** value is controlled in a practical sense by which strings are legal as an identifier in a resource file and a resource path.\n\n**x:Uid** is discrete from **x:Name** both because of the stated XAML localization scenario, and so that identifiers that are used for localization have no dependencies on the programming model implications of **x:Name**. Also, **x:Name** is governed by the XAML namescope concept, whereas uniqueness for **x:Uid** is controlled by the package resource index (PRI) system. For more info, see [Resource Management System](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj552947).\n\nUWP XAML has somewhat different rules for **x:Uid** uniqueness than previous XAML-utilizing technologies used. For UWP XAML it is legal for the same **x:Uid** ID value to exist as a directive on multiple XAML elements. However, each such element must then share the same resolution logic when resolving the resources in a resource file. Also, all XAML files in a project share a single resource scope for purposes of **x:Uid** resolution, there is no concept of **x:Uid** scopes being aligned to individual XAML files.\n\nIn some cases you'll be using a resource path rather than built-in functionality of the package resource index (PRI) system. Any string used as an **x:Uid** value defines a resource path that begins with ms-resource:///Resources/ and includes the **x:Uid** string. The path is completed by the names of the properties you specify in a resources file or are otherwise targeting.\n\nDon't put **x:Uid** on property elements, that isn't allowed in Windows Runtime XAML.\n\n"}
