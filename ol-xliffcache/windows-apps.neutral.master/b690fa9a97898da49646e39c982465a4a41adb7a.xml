Rather, because they run at a lower level in the Windows Runtime stack, they must interoperate with the user interface framework in a more fundamental way: by accessing and interoperating with the app object directly. Learn when and how this interoperation occurs, and how you, as a DirectX developer, can effectively use this model in the development of your UWP app. |\n| [Launching and resuming apps](launching-and-resuming-apps-directx-and-cpp.md) | Learn how to launch, suspend, and resume your UWP DirectX app. |\n| [2D graphics for DirectX games](working-with-2d-graphics-in-your-directx-game.md) | We discuss the use of 2D bitmap graphics and effects, and how to use them in your game. |\n| [Basic 3D graphics for DirectX games](an-introduction-to-3d-graphics-with-directx.md) | We show how to use DirectX programming to implement the fundamental concepts of 3D graphics. |\n| [Load resources in your DirectX game](load-a-game-asset.md) | Most games, at some point, load resources and assets (such as shaders, textures, predefined meshes or other graphics data) from local storage or some other data stream. Here, we walk you through a high-level view of what you must consider when loading these files to use in your UWP game. |\n| [Create a simple UWP game with DirectX](tutorial--create-your-first-metro-style-directx-game.md) | In this set of tutorials, you learn how to create a basic UWP game with DirectX and C++. We cover all the major parts of a game, including the processes for loading assets such as arts and meshes, creating a main game loop, implementing a simple rendering pipeline, and adding sound and controls. |\n| [Developing Marble Maze, a Universal Windows Platform game in C++ and DirectX](developing-marble-maze-a-windows-store-game-in-cpp-and-directx.md) | This section of the documentation describes how to use DirectX and Visual C++ to create a 3-D UWP game. This documentation shows how to create a 3-D game named Marble Maze that embraces new form factors such as tablets and also works on traditional desktop and laptop PCs. |\n| [Supporting screen orientation](supporting-screen-rotation-directx-and-cpp.md) | Here, we'll discuss best practices for handling screen rotation in your UWP DirectX app, so that the Windows 10 device's graphics hardware are used efficiently and effectively. |\n| [Audio for games](working-with-audio-in-your-directx-game.md) | Learn how to develop and incorporate music and sounds into your DirectX game, and how to process the audio signals to create dynamic and positional sounds. |\n| [Touch controls for games](tutorial--adding-touch-controls-to-your-directx-game.md) | Learn how to add basic touch controls to your UWP C++ game with DirectX.
