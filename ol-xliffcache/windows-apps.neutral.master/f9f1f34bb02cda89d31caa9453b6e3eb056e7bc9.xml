When overused it can be easily ignored by, or annoy, the user, making it ineffective.\n\nInstructional UI should be used to help the user discover important and non-obvious features of your app, such as touch gestures or settings they may be interested in. It can also be used to inform users about new features or changes in your app that they might have otherwise overlooked.\n\nUnless your app is dependent on touch gestures, instructional UI should not be used to teach users the fundamental features of your app.\n\n## <span id=\"writing_instructional_ui\"></span><span id=\"WRITING_INSTRUCTIONAL_UI\"></span>Principles of writing instructional UI\n\nGood instructional UI is relevant and educational to the user, and enhances the user experience. It should be:\n\n-   **Simple:** Users don't want their experience to be interrupted with complicated information.\n-   **Memorable:** Users don't want to see the same instructions every time they attempt a task, so instructions need to be something they'll remember.\n-   **Immediately relevant:** If the instructional UI doesn't teach a user about something that they immediately want to do, they won't have a reason to pay attention to it.\n\nAvoid overusing instructional UI, and be sure to choose the right topics. Do not teach:\n\n-   **Fundamental features:** If a user needs instructions to use your app, consider making the app design more intuitive.\n-   **Obvious features:** If a user can figure out a feature on their own without instruction, then the instructional UI will just get in the way.\n-   **Complex features:** Instructional UI needs to be concise. Users interested in complex features are usually willing to seek out instructions.\n\nAvoid inconveniencing the user with your instructional UI. Do not:\n\n-   **Obscure important information:** Instructional UI should never get in the way of other features of your app.\n-   **Force users to participate:** Users should be able to ignore instructional UI and still progress through the app.\n-   **Displaying repeat information:** Don't harass the user with instructional UI, even if they ignore it the first time.
