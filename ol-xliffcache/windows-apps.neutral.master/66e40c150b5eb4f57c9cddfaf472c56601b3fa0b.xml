main game object\n\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nAt this point, we've laid out the basic framework of the sample game, and we implemented a state machine that handles the high-level user and system behaviors. But we haven't examined the part that makes the game sample an actual game: the rules and mechanics, and how they're implemented! Now, we look at the details of the game sample's main object and how the rules it implements translate into interactions with the game world.\n\n## Objective\n\n\n-   To apply the basic development techniques when implementing the rules and mechanics of a simple Universal Windows Platform (UWP) game using DirectX.\n\n## Considering the game's flow\n\n\nThe majority of the game's basic structure is defined in these files:\n\n-   **App.cpp**\n-   **Simple3DGame.cpp**\n\nIn [Defining the game's UWP app framework](tutorial--building-the-games-metro-style-app-framework.md), we reviewed the game framework defined in **App.cpp**.\n\n**Simple3DGame.cpp** provides the code for a class, **Simple3DGame**, which specifies the implementation of the game play itself. Earlier, we considered the treatment of the sample game as a UWP app. Now, we look at the code that makes it a game.\n\nThe complete code for **Simple3DGame.h/.cpp** is provided in [Complete sample code for this section](#code_sample).\n\nLet's take a look at the definition of the **Simple3DGame** class.\n\n## Defining the core game object\n\n\nWhen the app singleton starts, the view provider's **Initialize** method creates an instance of the main game class, the **Simple3DGame** object. This object contains the methods that communicate changes in game state to the state machine defined in the app framework, or from the app to the game object itself. It also contains methods that return info for updating the game's overlay bitmap and heads-up display, and for updating the animations and physics (the dynamics) in the game. The code for obtaining the graphics device resources used by the game is found in GameRenderer.cpp, which we discuss next in [Assembling the rendering framework](tutorial--assembling-the-rendering-pipeline.md).\n\nThe code for **Simple3DGame** looks like this:\n\n```cpp\nref class GameRenderer;\n\nref class Simple3DGame\n{\ninternal:\n    Simple3DGame();\n\n    void Initialize(\n        _In_ MoveLookController^ controller,\n        _In_ GameRenderer^ renderer\n        );\n\n    void LoadGame();\n    concurrency::task<void> LoadLevelAsync();\n    void FinalizeLoadLevel();\n    void StartLevel();\n    void PauseGame();\n    void ContinueGame();\n    GameState RunGame();\n\n    void OnSuspending();\n    void OnResuming();\n\n    // ... Global variable retrieval methods are defined here ...\n\nprivate:\n    void LoadState();\n    void SaveState();\n    void SaveHighScore();\n    void LoadHighScore();\n    void InitializeAmmo();\n    void UpdateDynamics();\n\n    // ...\n                // ... Global variables are defined here.\n    // ...\n};\n```\n\nFirst, let's review the internal methods defined on **Simple3DGame**.\n\n-   **Initialize**. Sets the starting values of the global variables and initializes the game objects.\n-   **LoadGame**. Initializes a new level and starts loading it.\n-   **LoadLevelAsync**. Starts an async task (see the [Parallel Patterns Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dd492418.aspx) for more details) to initialize the level and then invoke an async task on the renderer to load the device specific level resources. This method runs in a separate thread; as a result, only [**ID3D11Device**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff476379) methods (as opposed to [**ID3D11DeviceContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff476385) methods) can be called from this thread. Any device context methods are called in the **FinalizeLoadLevel** method.\n-   **FinalizeLoadLevel**. Completes any work for level loading that needs to be done on the main thread. This includes any calls to Direct3D 11 device context ([**ID3D11DeviceContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff476385)) methods.\n-   **StartLevel**. Starts the game play for a new level.\n-   **PauseGame**. Pauses the game.\n-   **RunGame**. Runs an iteration of the game loop. It's called from **App::Update** one time every iteration of the game loop if the game state is **Active**.\n-   **OnSuspending** and **OnResuming**. Suspends and resumes the game's audio, respectively.\n\nAnd the private methods:\n\n-   **LoadSavedState** and **SaveState**. Loads and saves the current state of the game, respectively.\n-   **SaveHighScore** and **LoadHighScore**. Saves and loads the high score across games, respectively.\n-   **InitializeAmmo**. Resets the state of each sphere object used as ammunition back to its original state for the beginning of each round.\n-   **UpdateDynamics**. This is an important method, because it updates all the game objects based on canned animation routines, physics, and control input. This is the heart of the interactivity that defines the game. We talk about it more in the [Updating the game](#update_game) section.\n\nThe other public methods are property getters that return game play and overlay specific information to the app framework for display.\n\n## Defining the game state variables\n\n\nOne function of the game object is to serve as a container for the data that defines a game session, level, or lifetime, depending on how you define your game at a high level. In this case, the game state data is for the lifetime of the game, initialized one time when a user launches the game.\n\nHere's the complete set of definitions for the game object's state variables.\n\n```cpp\nprivate:\n    MoveLookController^                                 m_controller;\n    GameRenderer^                                       m_renderer;\n    Camera^                                             m_camera;\n\n    Audio^                                              m_audioController;\n\n    std::vector<Sphere^>                                m_ammo;\n    uint32                                              m_ammoCount;\n    uint32                                              m_ammoNext;\n\n    HighScoreEntry                                      m_topScore;\n    PersistentState^                                    m_savedState;\n\n    GameTimer^                                          m_timer;\n    bool                                                m_gameActive;\n    bool                                                m_levelActive;\n    int                                                 m_totalHits;\n    int                                                 m_totalShots;\n    float                                               m_levelDuration;\n    float                                               m_levelBonusTime;\n    float                                               m_levelTimeRemaining;\n    std::vector<Level^>                                 m_level;\n    uint32                                              m_levelCount;\n    uint32                                              m_currentLevel;\n\n    Sphere^                                             m_player;\n    std::vector<GameObject^>                            m_object;           // object list for intersections\n    std::vector<GameObject^>                            m_renderObject;     // all objects to be rendered\n\n    DirectX::XMFLOAT3                                   m_minBound;\n    DirectX::XMFLOAT3                                   m_maxBound;\n```\n\nAt the top of the code example, there are four objects whose instances are updated as the game loop runs.\n\n-   The **MoveLookController** object. This object represents the player input. (For more info about the **MoveLookController** object, see [Adding controls](tutorial--adding-controls.md).)\n-   The **GameRenderer** object. This object represents the Direct3D 11 renderer derived from the **DirectXBase** class that handles all the device-specific objects and their rendering. (For more info, see [Assembling the rendering pipeline](tutorial--assembling-the-rendering-pipeline.md)).\n-   The **Camera** object. This object represents the player's first-person view of the game world. (For more info about the **Camera** object, see [Assembling the rendering pipeline](tutorial--assembling-the-rendering-pipeline.md).)\n-   The **Audio** object. This object controls the audio playback for the game. (For more info about the **Audio** object, see [Adding sound](tutorial--adding-sound.md).)\n\nThe rest of the game variables contain the lists of the primitives and their respective in-game amounts, and game play specific data and constraints. Let's see how the sample configures these variables when the game is initialized.\n\n## Initializing and starting the game\n\n\nWhen a player starts the game, the game object must initialize its state, create and add the overlay, set the variables that track the player's performance, and instantiate the objects that it will use to build the levels.\n\n```cpp\nvoid Simple3DGame::Initialize(\n    _In_ MoveLookController^ controller,\n    _In_ GameRenderer^ renderer\n    )\n{\n    // This method is expected to be called as an asynchronous task.\n    // Make sure that you don't call rendering methods on the\n    // m_renderer as this would result in the D3D Context being\n    // used in multiple threads, which is not allowed.\n\n    m_controller = controller;\n    m_renderer = renderer;\n\n    m_audioController = ref new Audio;\n    m_audioController->CreateDeviceIndependentResources();\n\n    m_ammo = std::vector<Sphere^>(GameConstants::MaxAmmo);\n    m_object = std::vector<GameObject^>();\n    m_renderObject = std::vector<GameObject^>();\n    m_level = std::vector<Level^>();\n\n    m_savedState = ref new PersistentState();\n    m_savedState->Initialize(ApplicationData::Current->LocalSettings->Values, \"Game\");\n\n    m_timer = ref new GameTimer();\n\n    // Create a sphere primitive to represent the player.\n    // The sphere is used to handle collisions and constrain the player in the world.\n    // It's not rendered, so it's not added to the list of render objects.\n    m_player = ref new Sphere(XMFLOAT3(0.0f, -1.3f, 4.0f), 0.2f);\n\n    m_camera = ref new Camera;\n    m_camera->SetProjParams(XM_PI / 2, 1.0f, 0.01f, 100.0f);\n    m_camera->SetViewParams(\n        m_player->Position(),            // Eye point in world coordinates.\n        XMFLOAT3 (0.0f, 0.7f, 0.0f),     // Look at point in world coordinates.\n        XMFLOAT3 (0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)      // The Up vector for the camera.\n        );\n\n    m_controller->Pitch(m_camera->Pitch());\n    m_controller->Yaw(m_camera->Yaw());\n\n    // Add the m_player object to the object list to do intersection calculations.\n    m_object.push_back(m_player);\n    m_player->Active(true);\n\n    // Instantiate the world primitive.

A new audio playback object is created.\n2.  Arrays for the game's graphic primitives are created, including arrays for the level primitives, ammo, and obstacles.\n3.  A location for saving game state data is created, named *Game*, and placed in the app data settings storage location specified by [**ApplicationData::Current**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241619).\n4.  A game timer and the initial in-game overlay bitmap are created.\n5.  A new camera is created with a specific set of view and projection parameters.\n6.  The input device (the controller) is set to the same starting pitch and yaw as the camera, so the player has a 1-to-1 correspondence between the starting control position and the camera position.\n7.  The player object is created and set to active. We use a sphere object to detect the player's proximity to walls and obstacles and to keep the camera from getting put in a position that might break immersion.\n8.  The game world primitive is created.\n9.  The cylinder obstacles are created.\n10. The targets (**Face** objects) are created and numbered.\n11. The ammo spheres are created.\n12. The levels are created.\n13. The high score is loaded.\n14. Any prior saved game state is loaded.\n\nThe game now has instances of all the key components: the world, the player, the obstacles, the targets, and the ammo spheres. It also has instances of the levels, which represent configurations of all of the above components and their behaviors for each specific level. Let's see how the game builds the levels.\n\n## Building and loading the game's levels\n\n\nMost of the heavy lifting for the level construction is done in the **Level.h/.cpp** file, which we won't delve into, because it focuses on a very specific implementation. The important thing is that the code for each level is run as a separate **LevelN** object. If you'd like to extend the game, you can create a **Level** object that took an assigned number as a parameter and randomly placed the obstacles and targets. Or, you can have it load level configuration data from a resource file, or even the Internet!\n\nThe complete code for **Level.h/.cpp** is provided in [Complete sample code for this section](#code_sample).\n\n## Defining the game play\n\n\nAt this point, we have all the components we need to assemble the game. The levels have been constructed in memory from the primitives, and are ready for the player to start interacting with them in some fashion.\n\nNow, the best games react instantly to player input, and provide immediate feedback. This is true for any type of a game, from twitch-action, real-time shoot-em-ups to thoughtful, turn-based strategy games.\n\nIn [Defining the game's UWP framework](tutorial--building-the-games-metro-style-app-framework.md), we looked at the overall state machine that governs the flow of the game. Remember, the sample implements this flow as a loop inside the [**Run**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh702093) method of the **App** class, which itself is an implementation of a DirectX view provider. The important state transitions must be controlled by the player, and must provide clear feedback. Any delay in this feedback breaks the sense of immersion.\n\nHere is a diagram representing the basic flow of the game and its high-level states.\n\n![a diagram showing the main state machine for our game](images/simple3dgame-mainstatemachine.png)\n\nWhen the sample game starts play, the game object can be in one of three states:\n\n-   **Waiting for resources**. This state is activated when the game object is initialized or when the components of a level are being loaded. If this state was triggered by a request to load a prior game, the game stats overlay is displayed; if it was triggered by a request to play a level, the level start overlay is displayed. The completion of resource loading causes the game to pass through the **Resources loaded** state and then transition into the **Waiting for press** state.\n-   **Waiting for press**. This state is activated when the game is paused, either by the player or by the system (after, say, loading resources). When the player is ready to exit this state, the player is prompted to load a new game state (LoadGame), start or restart the loaded level (StartLevel), or continue the current level (ContinueGame).\n-   **Dynamics**. If a player's press input is completed and the resulting action is to start or continue a level, the game object transitions into the *Dynamics* state. The game is played in this state, and the game world and player objects are updated here based on animation routines and player input. This state is left when the player triggers a pause event, either by pressing P, by taking an action that deactivates the main window, or by completing a level or the game.\n\nNow, let's look at specific code in the **App** class (see: [Defining the game's UWP framework](tutorial--building-the-games-metro-style-app-framework.md)) for the **Update** method that implements this state machine.\n\n```cpp\nvoid App::Update()\n{\n    static uint32 loadCount = 0;\n\n    m_controller->Update();\n\n    switch (m_updateState)\n    {\n    case UpdateEngineState::WaitingForResources:\n        // Waiting for initial load.

thing this method does is call the [MoveLookController](tutorial--adding-controls.md) instance's own **Update** method, which updates the data from the controller. This data includes the direction the player's view (the camera) is facing and the velocity of the player's movement.\n\nWhen the game is in the Dynamics state, that is, when the player is playing, the work is handled in the **RunGame** method, with this call:\n\n`GameState runState = m_game->RunGame();`\n\n**RunGame** handles the set of data that defines the current state of the game play for the current iteration of the game loop. It flows like this:\n\n1.  The method updates the timer that counts down the seconds until the level is completed, and tests to see if the level's time has expired. This is one of the rules of the game: when time runs out without all the targets getting shot, the game is over.\n2.  If time has run out, the method sets the **TimeExpired** game state, and returns to the **Update** method in the previous code.\n3.  If time remains, the move-look controller is polled for an update to the camera position; specifically, an update to the angle of the view normal projecting from the camera plane (where the player is looking), and the distance that angle has moved from the previous time the controller was polled.\n4.  The camera is updated based on the new data from the move-look controller.\n5.  The dynamics, or the animations and behaviors of objects in the game world independent of player control, are updated. In the game sample, this is the motion of the ammo spheres that have been fired, the animation of the pillar obstacles and the movement of the targets.\n6.  The method checks to see if the criteria for the successful completion of a level have been met. If so, it finalizes the score for the level and checks to see if this is the last level (of 6). If it's the last level, the method returns the **GameComplete** game state; otherwise, it returns the **LevelComplete** game state.\n7.  If the level isn't complete, the method sets the game state to **Active** and returns.\n\nHere's what **RunGame**, found in **Simple3DGame.cpp**, looks like in code.\n\n```cpp\nGameState Simple3DGame::RunGame()\n{\n    m_timer->Update();\n\n    m_levelTimeRemaining = m_levelDuration - m_timer->PlayingTime();\n\n    if (m_levelTimeRemaining <= 0.0f)\n    {\n        // Time expired, so the game is over.\n        m_levelTimeRemaining = 0.0f;\n        InitializeAmmo();\n        m_timer->Reset();\n        m_gameActive = false;\n        m_levelActive = false;\n        SaveState();\n\n        if (m_totalHits > m_topScore.totalHits)\n        {\n            m_topScore.totalHits = m_totalHits;\n            m_topScore.totalShots = m_totalShots;\n            m_topScore.levelCompleted = m_currentLevel;\n\n            SaveHighScore();\n        }\n        return GameState::TimeExpired;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Time has not expired, so run one frame of game play.\n        m_player->Velocity(m_controller->Velocity());\n        m_camera->LookDirection(m_controller->LookDirection());\n\n        UpdateDynamics();\n\n        // Update the camera with the player position updates from the dynamics calculations.\n        m_camera->Eye(m_player->Position());\n        m_camera->LookDirection(m_controller->LookDirection());\n\n        if (m_level[m_currentLevel]->Update(m_timer->PlayingTime(), m_timer->DeltaTime(), m_levelTimeRemaining, m_object))\n        {\n            // The level has been completed.\n            m_levelActive = false;\n            InitializeAmmo();\n\n            if (m_currentLevel < m_levelCount-1)\n            {\n                // More levels to go so increment the level number.\n                // Actual level loading will occur in the LoadLevelAsync / FinalizeLoadLevel\n                // methods.\n                m_timer->Reset();\n                m_currentLevel++;\n                m_levelBonusTime = m_levelTimeRemaining;\n                SaveState();\n                return GameState::LevelComplete;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                // All levels have been completed.\n                m_timer->Reset();\n                m_gameActive = false;\n                m_levelActive = false;\n                SaveState();\n\n                if (m_totalHits > m_topScore.totalHits)\n                {\n                    m_topScore.totalHits = m_totalHits;\n                    m_topScore.totalShots = m_totalShots;\n                    m_topScore.levelCompleted = m_currentLevel;\n\n                    SaveHighScore();\n                }\n                return GameState::GameComplete;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return GameState::Active;\n}}\n```\n\nHere's the key call: `UpdateDynamics()`. It's what brings the game world to life. Let's review it!\n\n## Updating the game world\n\n\nA fast and fluid game experience is one where the world feels *alive*, where the game itself is in motion independent of player input. Trees wave in the wind, waves crest along shore lines, machinery smokes and shines, and alien monsters stretch and salivate. Imagine what a game would be like if everything was frozen, with the graphics only moving when the player provided input. It'd be weird and not very, well, immersive. Immersion, for the player, comes from the feeling of being an agent in a living, breathing world.\n\nThe game loop should always keep updating the game world and running the animation routines, be they canned or based on physical algorithms or just plain random, except when the game is specifically paused. In the game sample, this principle is called *dynamics*, and it encompasses the rise and fall of the pillar obstacles, and the motion and physical behaviors of the ammo spheres as they are fired. It also encompasses the interaction between objects, including collisions between the player sphere and the world, or between the ammo and the obstacles and targets.\n\nThe code that implements these dynamics looks like this:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Simple3DGame::UpdateDynamics()\n{\n    float timeTotal = m_timer->PlayingTime();\n    float timeFrame = m_timer->DeltaTime();\n    bool fire = m_controller->IsFiring();\n\n#pragma region Shoot Ammo\n    // Shoot ammo.\n    if (fire)\n    {\n        static float lastFired;

i < m_object.size(); i++)\n    {\n        if (m_object[i]->AnimatePosition())\n        {\n            // Animate targets and cylinders based on level parameters and global constants.\n        }\n    }\n#pragma endregion\n\n    // If the elapsed time is too long, we slice up the time and\n    // handle physics over several passes.\n    float timeLeft = timeFrame;\n    float elapsedFrameTime;\n    while (timeLeft > 0.0f)\n    {\n        elapsedFrameTime = min(timeLeft, GameConstants::Physics::FrameLength);\n        timeLeft -= elapsedFrameTime;\n\n        // Update the player position.\n        m_player->Position(m_player->VectorPosition() + m_player->VectorVelocity() * elapsedFrameTime);\n\n        // Do m_player / object intersections.\n        for (uint32 a = 0;

The full working code is found in the complete code sample at the bottom of this topic.)\n\nThis method deals with four sets of computations:\n\n-   The positions of the fired ammo spheres in the world.\n-   The animation of the pillar obstacles.\n-   The intersection of the player and the world boundaries.\n-   The collisions of the ammo spheres with the obstacles, the targets, other ammo spheres, and the world.\n\nThe animation of the obstacles is a loop defined in **Animate.h/.cpp**. The behavior of the ammo and any collisions are defined by simplified physics algorithms, supplied in the previous code and parameterized by a set of global constants for the game world, including gravity and material properties. This is all computed in the game world coordinate space.\n\nNow that we've updated all the objects in the scene and calculated any collisions, we need to use that info to draw the corresponding visual changes. After Update completes in the current iteration of the game loop, the sample immediately calls **Render** to take the updated object data and generate a new scene to present to the player.\n\nLet's look at the render method now.\n\n## Rendering the game world's graphics\n\n\nWe recommend that the graphics in a game update as often as possible, which, at maximum, is every time the main game loop iterates. As the loop iterates, the game is updated, with or without player input. This allows the animations and behaviors that are calculated to be displayed smoothly. Imagine if we had a simple scene of water that only moved when the player pressed a button. That would make for terribly boring visuals. A good game looks smooth and fluid.\n\nRecall the sample game's loop, as shown here. If the game's main window is visible, and isn't snapped or deactivated, the game continues to update and render the results of that update.\n\n```cpp\nvoid App::Run()\n{\n    while (!m_windowClosed)\n    {\n        if (m_visible)\n        {\n            switch (m_updateState)\n            {\n            case UpdateEngineState::Deactivated:\n            case UpdateEngineState::Snapped:\n                if (!m_renderNeeded)\n                {\n                    // The App is not currently the active window, so just wait for events.\n                    CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread()->Dispatcher->ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessOneAndAllPending);\n                    break;\n                }\n                // Otherwise, fall through and do normal processing to get the rendering handled.\n            default:\n                CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread()->Dispatcher->ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessAllIfPresent);\n                Update();\n                m_renderer->Render();\n                m_renderNeeded = false;\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread()->Dispatcher->ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessOneAndAllPending);\n        }\n    }\n    m_game->OnSuspending();  // Exiting due to window close.

When completed, it presents the final swap chain with the combined buffers for display.\n\nBe aware that there are two states for the sample game's Direct2D overlay: one where the game displays the game info overlay that contains the bitmap for the pause menu, and one where the game displays the cross hairs along with the rectangles for the touchscreen move-look controller. The score text is drawn in both states.\n\n## Next steps\n\n\nBy now, you're probably curious about the actual rendering engine: how those calls to the **Render** methods on the updated primitives get turned into pixels on your screen. We cover that in detail in [Assembling the rendering framework](tutorial--assembling-the-rendering-pipeline.md). If you're more interested in how the player controls update the game state, then check out [Adding controls](tutorial--adding-controls.md).\n\n## Complete code sample for this section\n\n\nSimple3DGame.h\n\n```cpp\n//// THIS CODE AND INFORMATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF\n//// ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\n//// THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A\n//// PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n////\n//// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
