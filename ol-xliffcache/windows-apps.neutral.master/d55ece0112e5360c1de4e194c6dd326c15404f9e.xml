(VCD) file, directed at an installed app through **Cortana**.\n\n> A VCD file defines one or more voice commands, each with a unique intent.\n\n> A voice command definition can vary in complexity. It can support anything from a single, constrained utterance to a collection of more flexible, natural language utterances, all denoting the same intent.\n\n\nThe target app can be launched in the foreground (the app takes focus and **Cortana** is dismissed) or activated in the background (**Cortana** retains focus but provides results from the app), depending on the complexity of the interaction. For example, voice commands that require additional context or user input are best handled in a foreground app, while basic commands can be handled in **Cortana** through a background app.\n\n \n\nBy integrating the basic functionality of your app, and providing a central entry point for the user to accomplish most of the tasks without opening your app directly, **Cortana** becomes a liaison between your app and the user.
