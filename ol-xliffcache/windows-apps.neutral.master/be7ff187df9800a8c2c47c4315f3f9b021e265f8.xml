This article describes the command elements, such as buttons and check boxes, the interactions they support, and the command surfaces (such as command bars and context menus) for hosting them.\n\n## <span id=\"Provide_the_right_type_of_interactions\"></span><span id=\"provide_the_right_type_of_interactions\"></span><span id=\"PROVIDE_THE_RIGHT_TYPE_OF_INTERACTIONS\"></span>Provide the right type of interactions\n\n\nWhen designing a command interface, the most important decision is choosing what users should be able to do. For example, if you're creating a photo app, the user will need tools to edit their photos. However, if you're creating a social media app that happens to display photos, image editing might not be a priority and so editing tools can be omitted to save space. Decide what you want users to accomplish and provide the tools to help them do it.\n\nFor recommendations about how to plan the right interactions for your app, see [Plan your app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465427.aspx).\n\n## <span id=\"Use_the_right_command_element_for_the_interaction\"></span><span id=\"use_the_right_command_element_for_the_interaction\"></span><span id=\"USE_THE_RIGHT_COMMAND_ELEMENT_FOR_THE_INTERACTION\"></span>Use the right command element for the interaction\n\n\nUsing the right elements for the right interactions can mean the difference between an app that feels intuitive to use and one that seems difficult or confusing.

Here are some general recommendations for placing commands:\n\n-   Whenever possible, let users directly manipulate the content on the app's canvas, rather than adding commands that act on the content. For example, in the travel app, let users rearrange their itinerary by dragging and dropping activities in a list on the canvas, rather than by selecting the activity and using Up or Down command buttons.\n-   Otherwise, place commands on one of these UI surfaces if users can't manipulate content directly:\n\n    -   In the [command bar](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465302): You should put most commands on the command bar, which helps to organize commands and makes them easy to access.\n    -   On the app's canvas: If the user is on a page or view that has a single purpose, you can provide commands for that purpose directly on the canvas.

Your app can help in these situations by requiring the user to confirm an action, or by providing a way of undoing recent actions.\n\n-   For actions that can't be undone and have major consequences, we recommend using a confirmation dialog. Examples of such actions include:\n    -   Overwriting a file\n    -   Not saving a file before closing\n    -   Confirming permanent deletion of a file or data\n    -   Making a purchase (unless the user opts out of requiring a confirmation)\n    -   Submitting a form, such as signing up for something\n-   For actions that can be undone, offering a simple undo command is usually enough. Examples of such actions include:\n    -   Deleting a file\n    -   Deleting an email (not permanently)\n    -   Modifying content or editing text\n    -   Renaming a file\n\n**Tip**  Be careful of how much your app uses confirmation dialogs; they can be very helpful when the user makes a mistake, but they are a hindrance whenever the user is trying to perform an action intentionally.\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"_________Optimize_for_specific_input_types_______\"></span><span id=\"_________optimize_for_specific_input_types_______\"></span><span id=\"_________OPTIMIZE_FOR_SPECIFIC_INPUT_TYPES_______\"></span> Optimize for specific input types\n\n\nSee the [Interaction primer](../input-and-devices/input-primer.md) for more detail on optimizing user experiences around a specific input type or device.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
