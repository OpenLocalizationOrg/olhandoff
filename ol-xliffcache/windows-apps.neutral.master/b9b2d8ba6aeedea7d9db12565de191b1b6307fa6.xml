a file\n\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\n**Important APIs**\n\n-   [**Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701461)\n\nLearn how to launch the default app for a file. Many apps need to work with files that they can't handle themselves. For example, e-mail apps receive a variety of file types and need a way to launch these files in their default handlers. These steps show how to use the [**Windows.System.Launcher**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241801) API to launch the default handler for a file that your app can't handle itself.\n\n## Get the file object\n\n\nFirst, get a [**Windows.Storage.StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) object for the file.\n\nIf the file is included in the package for your app, you can use the [**Package.InstalledLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224681) property to get a [**Windows.Storage.StorageFolder**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230) object and the [**Windows.Storage.StorageFolder.GetFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227272) method to get the [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) object.\n\nIf the file is in a known folder, you can use the properties of the [**Windows.Storage.KnownFolders**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227151) class to get a [**StorageFolder**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230) and the [**GetFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227272) method to get the [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) object.\n\n## Launch the file\n\n\nWindows provides several different options for launching the default handler for a file. These options are described in this chart and in the sections that follow.\n\n| Option | Method | Description |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Default launch | [**LaunchFileAsync(IStorageFile)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701471) | Launch the specified file with the default handler. |\n| Open With launch | [**LaunchFileAsync(IStorageFile, LauncherOptions)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701465) | Launch the specified file letting the user pick the handler through the Open With dialog. |\n| Launch with a recommended app fallback | [**LaunchFileAsync(IStorageFile, LauncherOptions)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701465) | Launch the specified file with the default handler.

By default, Windows will handle these cases by providing the user with a link to search for an appropriate app on the store. If you would like to give the user a specific recommendation for which app to acquire in this scenario, you may do so by passing that recommendation along with the file that you are launching. To do this, call the [**Windows.System.Launcher.launchFileAsync(IStorageFile, LauncherOptions)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701465) method with [**LauncherOptions.PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh965482) set to the package family name of the app in the Store that you want to recommend. Then, set the [**LauncherOptions.PreferredApplicationDisplayName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh965481) to the name of that app. Windows will use this information to replace the general option to search for an app in the store with a specific option to acquire the recommended app from the Store.\n\n> **Note**  You must set both of these options to recommend an app. Setting one without the other will result in a failure.\n\n![the open with dialog for a .contoso file launch. since .contoso does not have a handler installed on the machine the dialog contains an option with the store icon and text which points the user to the correct handler on the store. the dialog also contains a ‘more options’ link'.](images/howdoyouwanttoopen.png)\n\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```vb\n> async Sub DefaultLaunch()\n>\n>    ' Path to the file in the app package to launch\n>    Dim imageFile = \"images\\test.contoso\"\n>\n>    ' Get the image file from the package's image directory\n>    Dim file = await Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync(imageFile)\n>\n>    If file IsNot Nothing Then\n>       ' Set the recommended app\n>       Dim options = Windows.System.LauncherOptions()\n>       options.PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName = \"Contoso.FileApp_8wknc82po1e\";\n>       options.PreferredApplicationDisplayName = \"Contoso File App\";\n>\n>       ' Launch the retrieved file pass in the recommended app\n>       ' in case the user has no apps installed to handle the file\n>       Dim success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync(file)\n>\n>       If success Then\n>          ' File launched\n>       Else\n>          ' File launch failed\n>       End If\n>    Else\n>       ' Could not find file\n>    End If\n> End Sub\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n> void MainPage::DefaultLaunch()\n> {\n>    auto installFolder = Windows::ApplicationModel::Package::Current->InstalledLocation;\n>\n>    concurrency::task<Windows::Storage::StorageFile^> getFileOperation(installFolder->GetFileAsync(\"images\\\\test.contoso\"));\n>    getFileOperation.then([](Windows::Storage::StorageFile^ file)\n>    {\n>       if (file != nullptr)\n>       {\n>          // Set the recommended app\n>          auto launchOptions = ref new Windows::System::LauncherOptions();\n>          launchOptions-> preferredApplicationPackageFamilyName = \"Contoso.FileApp_8wknc82po1e\";\n>          launchOptions-> preferredApplicationDisplayName = \"Contoso File App\";\n>          \n>          // Launch the retrieved file pass in the recommended app\n>          // in case the user has no apps installed to handle the file\n>          concurrency::task<bool> launchFileOperation(Windows::System::Launcher::LaunchFileAsync(file, launchOptions));\n>          launchFileOperation.then([](bool success)\n>          {\n>             if (success)\n>             {\n>                // File launched\n>             }\n>             else\n>             {\n>                // File launch failed\n>             }\n>          });\n>       }\n>       else\n>       {\n>          // Could not find file\n>       }\n>    });\n> }\n> ```\n> ```cs\n> async void DefaultLaunch()\n> {\n>    // Path to the file in the app package to launch\n>    string imageFile = @\"images\\test.contoso\";\n>\n>    // Get the image file from the package's image directory\n>    var file = await Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync(imageFile);\n>\n>    if (file != null)\n>    {\n>       // Set the recommended app\n>       var options = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions();\n>       options.PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName = \"Contoso.FileApp_8wknc82po1e\";\n>       options.PreferredApplicationDisplayName = \"Contoso File App\";\n>\n>\n>       // Launch the retrieved file pass in the recommended app\n>       // in case the user has no apps installed to handle the file\n>       bool success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync(file, options);\n>       if (success)\n>       {\n>          // File launched\n>       }\n>       else\n>       {\n>          // File launch failed\n>       }\n>    }\n>    else\n>    {\n>       // Could not find file\n>    }\n> }\n> ```\n\n### Launch with a Desired Remaining View (Windows-only)\n\nSource apps that call [**LaunchFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701461) can request that they remain on screen after a file launch. By default, Windows attempts to share all available space equally between the source app and the target app that handles the file. Source apps can use the [**DesiredRemainingView**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314) property to indicate to the operating system that they prefer their app window to take up more or less of the available space. **DesiredRemainingView** can also be used to indicate that the source app does not need to remain on screen after the file launch and can be completely replaced by the target app. This property only specifies the preferred window size of the calling app. It doesn't specify the behavior of other apps that may happen to also be on screen at the same time.\n\n> **Note**  Windows takes into account multiple different factors when it determines the source app's final window size, for example, the preference of the source app, the number of apps on screen, the screen orientation, and so on. By setting [**DesiredRemainingView**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314), you aren't guaranteed a specific windowing behavior for the source app.\n\n**Mobile device family:  **[**LauncherOptions.DesiredRemainingView**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314) isn't supported on the mobile device family.\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cpp\n> void MainPage::DefaultLaunch()\n> {\n>    auto installFolder = Windows::ApplicationModel::Package::Current->InstalledLocation;\n>\n>    concurrency::task<Windows::Storage::StorageFile^> getFileOperation(installFolder->GetFileAsync(\"images\\\\test.png\"));\n>    getFileOperation.then([](Windows::Storage::StorageFile^ file)\n>    {\n>       if (file != nullptr)\n>       {\n>          // Set the desired remaining view\n>          auto launchOptions = ref new Windows::System::LauncherOptions();\n>          launchOptions->DesiredRemainingView = Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ViewSizePreference.UseLess;\n>\n>          // Launch the retrieved file\n>          concurrency::task<bool> launchFileOperation(Windows::System::Launcher::LaunchFileAsync(file, launchOptions));\n>          launchFileOperation.then([](bool success)\n>          {\n>             if (success)\n>             {\n>                // File launched\n>             }\n>             else\n>             {\n>                // File launch failed\n>             }\n>          });\n>       }\n>       else\n>       {\n>          // Could not find file\n>       }\n>    });\n> }\n> ```\n> ```cs\n> async void DefaultLaunch()\n> {\n>    // Path to the file in the app package to launch\n>    string imageFile = @\"images\\test.png\";\n>    \n>    var file = await Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync(imageFile);\n>\n>    if (file != null)\n>    {\n>       // Set the desired remaining view\n>       var options = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions();\n>       options.DesiredRemainingView = Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ViewSizePreference.UseLess;\n>\n>       // Launch the retrieved file\n>       bool success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchFileAsync(file, options);\n>       if (success)\n>       {\n>          // File launched\n>       }\n>       else\n>       {\n>          // File launch failed\n>       }\n>    }\n>    else\n>    {\n>       // Could not find file\n>    }\n> }\n> ```\n\n## Remarks\n\nYour app can't select the app that is launched. The user determines which app is launched. The user can select either a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app or a Classic Windows Platform (CWP) app.\n\nWhen launching a file, your app must be the foreground app, that is, it must be visible to the user. This requirement helps ensure that the user remains in control. To meet this requirement, make sure that you tie all file launches directly to the UI of your app. Most likely, the user must always take some action to initiate a file launch.\n\nYou can't launch file types that contain code or script if they are executed automatically by the operating system, such as, .exe, .msi, and .js files. This restriction protects users from potentially malicious files that could modify the operating system. You can use this method to launch file types that can contain script if they are executed by an app that isolates the script, such as, .docx files. Apps like Microsoft Word keep the script in .docx files from modifying the operating system.\n\nIf you try to launch a restricted file type, the launch will fail and your error callback will be invoked. If your app handles many different types of files and you expect that you will hit this error, we recommend that you provide a fallback experience to your user. For example, you could give the user an option to save the file to the desktop, and they could open it there.\n\n> **Note**  This article is for Windows 10 developers writing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.
