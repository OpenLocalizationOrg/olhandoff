In Retail Mode, the console is in the state that any customer or user of an Xbox One console would use: you can play games and run apps as a user. In Developer Mode, you can develop software for the console, but you cannot play retail games or run retail apps.\nDeveloper Mode can be enabled on any retail Xbox One console. After Developer Mode is enabled, you can switch back and forth between Retail (2a) and Developer Modes (2b).\n\n> **Important**&nbsp;&nbsp;When you activate Developer Mode on Xbox One, you are opting into Xbox system updates for a developer preview release that includes experimental and early pre-release software. This means that some popular games and apps will not work as expected, and you may experience occasional crashes and data loss. If you leave the developer preview, your console will factory reset and you will have to reinstall all of your games, apps, and content. \n\n> **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot activate Developer Mode on Xbox One if you are part of an existing preview program such as the Xbox One Beta program. You can leave an existing preview program by using the Xbox Preview Dashboard app. \n\n![Xbox One modes](images/dev-mode-flow.png)\n\n## Activate Developer Mode on your retail Xbox One console\n\n1.  Start your Xbox One console.\n\n2.  Search for and install the Dev Mode Activation app from the Xbox One store.  \n    ![](images/activation-store-search.png)\n\n3.

Enter the activation code displayed in the Dev Mode Activation app.   \n   \n     > **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a limited number of activations associated with your account. After Developer Mode has been activated, Dev Center will indicate you have used one of the activations associated with your account. \n    \n    ![Activation Step 8](images/activation-step-8.png)    \n    \n9.

After activation completes, you will have to wait for your console to update to the required preview build. This may take several hours; please be patient.  \n\n    ![Activation Step 11](images/activation-step-11.png)    \n    \n12. After activation has completed, open the Dev Mode Activation app and click **Switch and restart** to go to Developer Mode. Note that this will take longer than usual.  \n\n    ![Activation Step 12](images/activation-step-12.png)   \n    \n\n    \n## Switch between Retail and Developer Mode\nAfter Developer Mode has been enabled on your console, use **Dev Home** to switch between Retail Mode and Developer Mode. To learn more about starting and using **Dev Home**, see [Introduction to Xbox One tools](introduction-to-xbox-tools.md).\n\n* To switch to Retail Mode, use **Dev Home** and click **Leave developer mode**.
