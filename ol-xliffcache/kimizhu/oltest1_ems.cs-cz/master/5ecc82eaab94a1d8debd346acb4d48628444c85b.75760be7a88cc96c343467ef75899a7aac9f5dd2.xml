If integration is required, your source environment must be at a minimum level for that application.\n\nThe following table shows what is expected in your existing source environment for onboarding.\n\n|Activity|Source environment expectation|\n|------------|----------------------------------|\n|Core capabilities|Active Directory forests with the functional forest level set to Windows Server 2008 or above, with the following forest configuration:<br /><br />-   Single Active Directory forest<br />-   Multiple Active Directory forests **Note:** For all multiple forests configurations, AD FS deployment is out of scope for the FastTrack Center Benefit.|\n|Service onboarding<br /><br />-   Azure RMS|On-premises Active Directory and environment have been prepared for Azure RMS, which includes remediation of identified issues that would prevent integration with Azure AD and Azure RMS features.|\n\n## <a name=\"phases_onboarding_process_rms\"></a>Phases of the onboarding process\nAzure RMS onboarding has five primary phases, as shown in the following figure:\n\n-   Initiate\n\n-   Assess\n\n-   Remediate\n\n-   Enable\n\n![](../Image/Intune_onboarding_phases_9-15-15.png)\n\nFor detailed tasks for each phase, see the [Microsoft responsibilities](#microsoft_responsibilities_rms) and  [Your responsibilities](#your_responsibilities_rms) sections.\n\n### Initiate phase\nAfter you have purchased the appropriate number of licenses, follow the guidance from the purchase confirmation email to associate the licenses to your existing tenant or new tenant. Microsoft will verify your eligibility for the FastTrack Center Benefit. Microsoft will attempt to contact you within 30 days from the date you purchase an eligible plan. You can also request assistance from the [FastTrack Center](http://fasttrack.microsoft.com/) if you are ready to deploy these services for your organization. To request assistance, sign in to the FastTrack Center (http://fasttrack.microsoft.com), go to the dashboard, select your company name, click the Offers tab, and click the request assistance button for the eligible service.\n\nDuring this phase, we’ll discuss the onboarding process, verify data, and set up a kick-off meeting.\n\n![](../Image/Microsoft_Azure_AD_Premium_initiate_phase_1.png)\n\n### Assess phase\nOnce the onboarding process begins, Microsoft will work with you to assess your source environment and the requirements. Tools will be run to assess your environment, and Microsoft will guide you through assessing your on-premises Active Directory, Internet browsers, client devices' operating systems, DNS, network, infrastructure, and identity system to determine if any changes are required for onboarding. Based on your current setup, we’ll provide a remediation plan that will bring your source environment up to the minimum requirements for successful onboarding to Azure RMS. We’ll also set up appropriate checkpoint calls for the remediation phase.\n\n![](../Image/Microsoft_Azure_AD_Premium_assess_phase_v6.png)\n\n### Remediate phase\nIf needed, you’ll do the tasks in the remediation plan on your source environment so that you meet the requirements for onboarding each service.\n\n![](../Image/Microsoft_Azure_AD_Premium_remediate_phase_1.png)\n\nBefore beginning the Enable phase, we’ll jointly verify the outcomes of the remediation activities to make sure you’re ready to proceed.\n\n### Enable phase\nWhen all remediation activities are complete, the project shifts to configuring the core infrastructure for service consumption and to provisioning Azure RMS.\n\n**Enable phase - Core capabilities**\n\nEnabling core capabilities involves service provisioning and tenant and identity integration. It also includes steps for providing a foundation for onboarding Microsoft Azure RMS.\n\nOnboarding for Azure RMS can begin when core onboarding is finished.\n\n**Enable phase – Azure RMS**\n\nThe Azure RMS environment can be set up with Azure AD Connect directory synchronization and Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), as needed.\n\nFor Azure RMS scenarios that include synchronizing on-premises identities to the cloud, we’ll help you by adding IT administrators and users to your subscription, configuring management prerequisites, setting up Azure RMS, setting up directory synchronization using Azure AD Connect, and Active Directory Federation Services using Azure AD Connect, configuring test users and validating your core use cases for the service.\n\nAzure RMS setup includes enabling the following features:\n\n-   RMS Service Enablement\n\n-   IRM Configuration for Exchange Online and Sharepoint Online\n\n-   Rights Management Connector with Exchange on-premise and Sharepoint on-premise\n\n-   RMS Sharing Application for Windows and non-Windows devices\n\n![](../Image/Microsoft_Azure_AD_Premium_enable_phase_2.png)\n\n## <a name=\"microsoft_responsibilities_rms\"></a>Microsoft responsibilities\n\n### General\n\n-   Provide remote support assistance to you for the required configuration activities, as described in the detailed phase descriptions.\n\n-   Provide available documentation and software tools, admin consoles, and scripts to help you reduce or eliminate configuration tasks.\n\nProviding access and permissions to Microsoft isn’t required to use the FastTrack Center benefit. In some cases, you can choose to give Microsoft the appropriate access and permissions to perform specific activities on your behalf.\n\n### Initiate phase\n\n-   Contact you within 30 days of the purchase of eligible licenses for a new tenant.\n\n-   Define which eligible services you want to onboard.\n\n### Assess phase\n\n-   Provide an administrative overview.\n\n-   Provide guidance with:\n\n    -   DNS, network, and infrastructure needs.\n\n    -   Client needs (Internet browser, client operating system, and services' needs).\n\n    -   User identity and provisioning.\n\n    -   Identification of Directory Synchronization requirements.\n\n    -   Enabling of eligible services that have been purchased and defined to be part of the onboarding.\n\n    -   Identification of required piloting and test environment requirements.\n\n-   Establish the timeline for remediation activities.\n\n-   Provide a remediation checklist.\n\n### Remediate phase\n\n-   Hold conference calls with you according to the agreed-upon schedule to review the progress of the remediation activities.\n\n-   Assist with running tools to identify and remediate issues, and with interpreting the results.\n\n### Enable phase\nProvide guidance about:\n\n-   Activating your Azure RMS tenant.\n\n-   Configuring firewall ports.\n\n-   Configuring DNS for eligible services.\n\n-   Validating connectivity to Azure RMS services.\n\n-   For a single-forest environment:\n\n    -   Installing a directory synchronization between your Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure AD Connect, if required.\n\n    -   Configuring password synchronization with the Azure AD Connect tool.\n\n-   For a multiple forest environment:\n\n    -   Installing Azure AD Connect synchronization, set up for multiple forest scenarios.
