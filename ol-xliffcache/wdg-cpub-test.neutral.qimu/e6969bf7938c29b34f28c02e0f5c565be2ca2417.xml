This must be a dependency property. |\n| sourceProperty | The name of another dependency property that exists on the type being templated. |\n\n## Remarks\n\nUsing **TemplateBinding** is a fundamental part of how you define a control template, either if you are a custom control author or if you are replacing a control template for existing controls. For more info, see [Quickstart: Control templates](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh465374).\n\nIt's fairly common for *propertyName* and *targetProperty* to use the same property name. In this case, a control might define a property on itself and forward the property to an existing and intuitively named property of one of its component parts. For example, a control that incorporates a [**TextBlock**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209652) in its compositing, which is used to display the control's own **Text** property, might include this XAML as a part in the control template: `<TextBlock Text=\"{TemplateBinding Text}\" .... />`\n\nThe types used as the value for the source property and the target property must match. There's no opportunity to introduce a converter when you're using **TemplateBinding**. Failing to match values results in an error when parsing the XAML. If you need a converter you can use the verbose syntax for a template binding such as: `{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}, Converter=\"...\" ...}`\n\nAttempting to use a **TemplateBinding** outside of a [**ControlTemplate**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209391) definition in XAML will result in a parser error.\n\nYou can use **TemplateBinding** for cases where the templated parent value is also deferred as another binding. The evaluation for **TemplateBinding** can wait until any required runtime bindings have values.\n\nA **TemplateBinding** is always a one-way binding. Both properties involved must be dependency properties.\n\n**TemplateBinding** is a markup extension. Markup extensions are typically implemented when there is a requirement to escape attribute values to be other than literal values or handler names, and the requirement is more global than just putting type converters on certain types or properties. All markup extensions in XAML use the \"{\" and \"}\" characters in their attribute syntax, which is the convention by which a XAML processor recognizes that a markup extension must process the attribute.\n\n**Note**  In the Windows Runtime XAML processor implementation, there is no backing class representation for **TemplateBinding**. **TemplateBinding** is exclusively for use in XAML markup.
