color is also personal. Users can choose a color and a light or dark theme to be reflected throughout their experience.\n\n## Accent color\n\nThe user can pick a single color called the accent from *Settings > Personalization > Colors*. They have their choice from a curated set of 48 color swatches, except on Xbox which has a palette of 21 TV-safe colors.\n\n<!-- Alternate version for the dev center. Need to add hex values. -->\n![Default accent colors](images/accentcolorswatch.png)\nDefault accent colors\n\n![Xbox accent colors](images/accentcolorswatch_xbox.png)\nXbox accent colors\n\n\n\nWhen users choose an accent color, it appears as part of their system theme. The areas affected are Start, Taskbar, window chrome, selected interaction states and hyperlinks within [common controls](https://dev.windows.com/design/controls-patterns). Each app can further incorporate the accent color through their typography, backgrounds, and interactions—or override it to preserve their specific branding.\n\n## Color on color\n\nOnce an accent color is selected, light and dark shades of the accent color are created based on HSB values of color luminosity. Apps can use shade variations to create visual hierarchy and to provide an indication of interaction.\n\nBy default, hyperlinks will use the user's accent color. If the page background is a similar color, you can choose to assign a lighter (or darker) shade of accent to the hyperlinks for better contrast.\n\n<figure class=\"figure-img\" >\n    <img src=\"images/shades.png\" alt=\"A single accent color with its 6 shades\"  />\n        <figcaption><p>The various light/dark shades of the default accent color.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure class=\"figure-img\" >\n    <img src=\"images/action_center_redline_zoom.png\" alt=\"Redlines for Colored Action Center\"  />\n        <figcaption><p>An example of how color logic gets applied to a design spec.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<aside class=\"aside-dev\">\n    <div class=\"aside-dev-title\">\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"aside-dev-content\">\n            In XAML, the primary accent color is exposed as a [theme resource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Mt187274.aspx) named `SystemAccentColor`.
