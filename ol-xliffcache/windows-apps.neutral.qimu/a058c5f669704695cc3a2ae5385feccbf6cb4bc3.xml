Both iOS and Android utilize the same specification and OpenGL ES 2.0 code developed for those platforms is very similar to the code snippets we will walk through, although they are typically exposed as object-oriented APIs. Also, due to the intricacies and language differences of each platform, there may be minor differences, especially in method parameter types, or in general language syntax. iOS, for instance, uses Objective-C. Android has the capability to use C++; however, some developers may have relied on a pure Java implementation. With that in mind, these topics should still be useful as the overall concepts, structure and usage of the OpenGL ES APIs do not differ.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
