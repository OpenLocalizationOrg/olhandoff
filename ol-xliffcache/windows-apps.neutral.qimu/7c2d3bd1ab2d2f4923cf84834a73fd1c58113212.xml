When it's not, we often use different words and word order to get the same idea across.\n\nNatural language interactions with an app are similar: we speak to the app through our device as if it were a person and expect it to understand and react accordingly.\n\nNatural language is the most advanced mode of speech interaction, and can be implemented and exposed through **Cortana**.\n\n<span id=\"Command_and_control\"></span><span id=\"command_and_control\"></span><span id=\"COMMAND_AND_CONTROL\"></span>Command and control  \nCommand and control is the use of verbal commands to activate controls and functionality such as clicking a button or selecting a menu item.\n\nAs command and control is critical to a successful user experience, a single input type is generally not recommended. Speech is typically one of several input options for a user based on their preferences or hardware capabilities.\n\n<span id=\"Dictation\"></span><span id=\"dictation\"></span><span id=\"DICTATION\"></span>Dictation  \nThe most basic speech input method. Each utterance is converted to text.\n\nDictation is typically used when an app doesnâ€™t need to understand meaning or intent.\n\nMore info\n[Speech design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn596121)\n \n\n## <span id=\"Pen\"></span><span id=\"pen\"></span><span id=\"PEN\"></span>Pen\n\n\nA pen (or stylus) can serve as a pixel precise pointing device, like a mouse, and is the optimal device for digital ink input.\n\n**Note**  There are two types of pen devices: active and passive.\n-   Passive pens do not contain electronics, and effectively emulate touch input from a finger. They require a basic device display that recognizes input based on contact pressure. Because users often rest their hand as they write on the input surface, input data can become polluted due to unsuccessful palm rejection.\n-   Active pens contain electronics and can work with complex device displays to provide much more extensive input data (including hover, or proximity data) to the system and your app. Palm rejection is much more robust.\n\n \n\nWhen we refer to pen devices here, we are referring to active pens that provide rich input data and are used primarily for precise ink and pointing interactions.\n\nDevice support\n-   Phones and phablets\n-   Tablet\n-   PCs and laptops\n-   Surface Hub\n-   IoT\n\n![pen](images/input-interactions/icons-pen01.png)\n\nTypical usage\nThe Windows ink platform, together with a pen, provides a natural way to create handwritten notes, drawings, and annotations. The platform supports capturing ink data from digitizer input, generating ink data, rendering that data as ink strokes on the output device, managing the ink data, and performing handwriting recognition. In addition to capturing the spatial movements of the pen as the user writes or draws, your app can also collect info such as pressure, shape, color, and opacity, to offer user experiences that closely resemble drawing on paper with a pen, pencil, or brush.\n\nWhere pen and touch input diverge is the ability for touch to emulate direct manipulation of UI elements on the screen through physical gestures performed on those objects (such as swiping, sliding, dragging, rotating, and so on).\n\nYou should provide pen-specific UI commands, or affordances, to support these interactions. For example, use previous and next (or + and -) buttons to let users flip through pages of content, or rotate, resize, and zoom objects.\n\nMore info\n[Pen design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn456352)\n \n\n## <span id=\"Touch\"></span><span id=\"touch\"></span><span id=\"TOUCH\"></span>Touch\n\n\nWith touch, physical gestures from one or more fingers can be used to either emulate the direct manipulation of UI elements (such as panning, rotating, resizing, or moving), as an alternative input method (similar to mouse or pen), or as a complementary input method (to modify aspects of other input, such as smudging an ink stroke drawn with a pen). Tactile experiences such as this can provide more natural, real-world sensations for users as they interact with elements on a screen.\n\nDevice support\n-   Phones and phablets\n-   Tablet\n-   PCs and laptops\n-   Surface Hub\n-   IoT\n\n![touch](images/input-interactions/icons-touch01.png)\n\nTypical usage\nSupport for touch input can vary significantly, depending on the device.\n\nSome devices don't support touch at all, some devices support a single touch contact, while others support multi-touch (two or more contacts).\n\nMost devices that support multi-touch input, typically recognize ten unique, concurrent contacts.\n\nSurface Hub devices recognize 100 unique, concurrent touch contacts.\n\nIn general, touch is:\n\n-   Single user, unless being used with a Microsoft Team device like Surface Hub, where collaboration is emphasized.\n-   Not constrained to device orientation.\n-   Used for all interactions, including text input (touch keyboard) and inking (app-configured).\n\nMore info\n[Touch design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465370)\n \n\n## <span id=\"Touchpad\"></span><span id=\"touchpad\"></span><span id=\"TOUCHPAD\"></span>Touchpad\n\n\nA touchpad combines both indirect multi-touch input with the precision input of a pointing device, such as a mouse. This combination makes the touchpad suited to both a touch-optimized UI and the smaller targets of productivity apps.\n\nDevice support\n-   PCs and laptops\n-   IoT\n\n![touchpad](images/input-interactions/icons-touchpad01.png)\n\nTypical usage\nTouchpads typically support a set of touch gestures that provide support similar to touch for direct manipulation of objects and UI.\n\nBecause of this convergence of interaction experiences supported by touchpads, we recommend also providing mouse-style UI commands or affordances rather than relying solely on support for touch input. Provide touchpad-specific UI commands, or affordances, to support these interactions.\n\nYou should provide mouse-specific UI commands, or affordances, to support these interactions.

The OSK is provided for systems that don't have a physical keyboard, or for users whose mobility impairments prevent them from using traditional physical input devices. The OSK emulates most, if not all, the functionality of a hardware keyboard.\n\nThe touch keyboard is a visual, software keyboard used for text entry with touch input. The touch keyboard is not a replacement for the OSK as it is used for text input only (it doesn't emulate the hardware keyboard) and appears only when a text field or other editable text control gets focus. The touch keyboard does not support app or system commands.\n\n**Note**  The OSK has priority over the touch keyboard, which won't be shown if the OSK is present.\n\n \n\nIn general, a keyboard is:\n\n-   Single user.\n-   Not constrained to device orientation.\n-   Used for text input, navigation, gameplay, and accessibility.\n-   Always available, either proactively or reactively.\n\nMore info\n[Keyboard design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh972345)\n \n\n## <span id=\"Mouse\"></span><span id=\"mouse\"></span><span id=\"MOUSE\"></span>Mouse\n\n\nA mouse is best suited for productivity apps and high-density UI where user interactions require pixel-level precision for targeting and commanding.\n\nDevice support\n-   Phones and phablets\n-   Tablet\n-   PCs and laptops\n-   Surface Hub\n-   IoT\n\n![mouse](images/input-interactions/icons-mouse01.png)\n\nTypical usage\nMouse input can be modified with the addition of various keyboard keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and so on). These keys can be combined with the left mouse button, the right mouse button, the wheel button, and the X buttons for an expanded mouse-optimized command set. (Some Microsoft mouse devices have two additional buttons, referred to as X buttons, typically used to navigate back and forward in Web browsers).\n\nSimilar to pen, where mouse and touch input diverge is the ability for touch to emulate direct manipulation of UI elements on the screen through physical gestures performed on those objects (such as swiping, sliding, dragging, rotating, and so on).\n\nYou should provide mouse-specific UI commands, or affordances, to support these interactions. For example, use previous and next (or + and -) buttons to let users flip through pages of content, or rotate, resize, and zoom objects.\n\nMore info\n[Mouse design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn456351)\n \n\n## <span id=\"Gesture\"></span><span id=\"gesture\"></span><span id=\"GESTURE\"></span>Gesture\n\n\nA gesture is any form of user movement that is recognized as input for controlling or interacting with an application. Gestures take many forms, from simply using a hand to target something on the screen, to specific, learned patterns of movement, to long stretches of continuous movement using the entire body. Be careful when designing custom gestures, as their meaning can vary depending on locale and culture.\n\nDevice support\n-   PCs and laptops\n-   IoT\n-   Xbox\n-   HoloLens\n\n![gesture](images/input-interactions/icons-gesture01.png)\n\nTypical usage\nTouchpads typically support a set of touch gestures that provide support similar to touch for direct manipulation of objects and UI.\n\nBecause of this convergence of interaction experiences supported by touchpads, we recommend also providing mouse-style UI commands or affordances rather than relying solely on support for touch input.
