The system resumes your app whenever the user switches back to it. When the system resumes your app, the content of your variables and data structures is the same as it was before the system suspended the app. The system restores the app exactly where it left off, so that it appears to the user as if it's been running in the background. However, the app may have been suspended for a significant amount of time, so it should refresh any displayed content that might have changed while the app was suspended, such as news feeds or the user's location.\n\nIf your app doesn't have any displayed content to refresh, there's no need for it to handle the [**Resuming**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242339) event.\n\n> **Note** When your app is attached to the Visual Studio debugger, you can send it a **Resume** event. Make sure the **Debug Location toolbar** is visible and click the drop-down next to the **Suspend** icon. Then choose **Resume**.\n\n> **Note**  For Windows Phone Store apps, the [**Resuming**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242339) event is always followed by [**OnLaunched**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242335), even when your app is currently suspended and the user re-launches your app from a primary tile or app list. Apps can skip initialization if there is already content set on the current window. You can check the [**LaunchActivatedEventArgs.TileId**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224736) property to determine if the app was launched from a primary or a secondary tile and, based on that information, decide whether you should present a fresh or resume app experience.\n\n## Related topics\n\n* [Handle app activation](activate-an-app.md)\n* [Handle app suspend](suspend-an-app.md)\n* [Guidelines for app suspend and resume](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465088)\n* [App lifecycle](app-lifecycle.md)\n"}
