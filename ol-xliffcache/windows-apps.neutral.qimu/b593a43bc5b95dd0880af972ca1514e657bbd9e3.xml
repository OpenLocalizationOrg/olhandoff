For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\n**Important APIs**\n\n-   [**LaunchUriAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701476)\n-   [**PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh965482)\n-   [**DesiredRemainingView**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314)\n\nLearn how to launch the default app for a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). URIs allow you to launch another app to perform a specific task. This topic also provides an overview of the many URI schemes built into Windows. You can launch custom URIs too. For more info about registering a custom URI scheme and handling URI activation, see [Handle URI activation](handle-uri-activation.md).\n\n## How to launch a URI\n\n\nURI schemes let you open apps by clicking hyperlinks. Just as you can start a new email using **mailto:**, you can open the default web browser using **http:**. This topic describes some of the URI schemes built into Windows:\n\n-   The [ms-settings: URI scheme](#settings) launches the Windows Settings app\n-   The [ms-store: URI scheme](#store) launches the Windows Store app\n-   The [http: URI scheme](#browser) launches the default web browser\n-   The [mailto: URI scheme](#email) launches the default email app\n-   The [bingmaps:, ms-drive-to:, and ms-walk-to: URI schemes](#maps) launch the Windows Maps app\n\nFor example, the following URI opens the default browser and displays the Bing web site.\n\n`http://bing.com`\n\nYou can also launch custom URI schemes too. If there is no app installed to handle that URI, you can recommend an app ror the user to install. For more info, see [Recommend an app](#recommend).\n\nIn general, your app can't select the app that is launched. The user determines which app is launched. More than one app can register to handle the same URI scheme. The exception to this is for reserved URI schemes. Registrations of reserved URI schemes are ignored. For the full list of reserved URI schemes, see [Handle URI activation](handle-uri-activation.md). In cases where more than one app may have registered the same URI scheme, your app can recommend a specific app to be launched. For more info, see [Recommend an app](#recommend).\n\n### Call LaunchUriAsync\n\nUse the [**LaunchUriAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701476) method to launch a URI. When you call this method, your app must be the foreground app, that is, it must be visible to the user. This requirement helps ensure that the user remains in control. To meet this requirement, make sure that you tie all URI launches directly to the UI of your app. The user must always take some action to initiate a URI launch. If you attempt to launch a URI and your app isn't in the foreground, the launch will fail and your error callback will be invoked.\n\nFirst create a [**System.Uri**](T:System.Uri) object to represent the URI, then pass that to the [**LaunchUriAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701476) method. Use the return result to see if the call succeeded, as shown in the following example.\n\n```cs\nprivate async void launchURI_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n   // The URI to launch\n   var uriBing = new Uri(@\"http://www.bing.com\");\n\n   // Launch the URI\n   var success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriBing);\n\n   if (success)\n   {\n      // URI launched\n   }\n   else\n   {\n      // URI launch failed\n   }\n}\n```\n\nIn some cases, the operating system will prompt the user to see if the actually want to switch apps.\n\n![a warning dialog overlayed on a grayed out background of the app. the dialog asks the user if they want to switch apps and has ‘yes’ and ‘no’ buttons in the bottom right. the ‘no’ button is highlighted.](images/warningdialog.png)\n\nIf you always want this prompt to occur, use the [**Windows.System.LauncherOptions.TreatAsUntrusted**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701442) property to indicate that the operating system display a warning.\n\n```cs\n// The URI to launch\nvar uriBing = new Uri(@\"http://www.bing.com\");\n\n// Set the option to show a warning\nvar promptOptions = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions();\npromptOptions.TreatAsUntrusted = true;\n\n// Launch the URI\nvar success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriBing, promptOptions);\n```\n\n### Recommend an app\n\nIn some cases, the user might not have an app installed to handle the URI that you are launching. By default, the operating system handles these cases by providing the user with a link to search for an appropriate app on the store. If you want to give the user a specific recommendation for which app to acquire in this scenario, you can do so by passing that recommendation along with the URI that you are launching.\n\nRecommendations are also useful when more than one app has registered to handle a URI scheme. By recommending a specific app, Windows will open that app if it is already installed.\n\nTo make a recommendation, call the [**Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(Uri, LauncherOptions)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701484) method with [**LauncherOptions.preferredApplicationPackageFamilyName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh965482) set to the package family name of the app in the store that you want to recommend. The operating system uses this info to replace the general option to search for an app in the store with a specific option to acquire the recommended app from the store.\n\n```cs\n// Set the recommended app\nvar options = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions();\noptions.PreferredApplicationPackageFamilyName = \"Contoso.URIApp_8wknc82po1e\";\noptions.PreferredApplicationDisplayName = \"Contoso URI Ap\";\n\n// Launch the URI and pass in the recommended app\n// in case the user has no apps installed to handle the URI\nvar success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriContoso, options);\n```\n\n### Set remaining view preference\n\nSource apps that call [**LaunchUriAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701476) can request that they remain on screen after a URI launch. By default, Windows attempts to share all available space equally between the source app and the target app that handles the URI. Source apps can use the [**DesiredRemainingView**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314) property to indicate to the operating system that they prefer their app window to take up more or less of the available space. **DesiredRemainingView** can also be used to indicate that the source app doesn't need to remain on screen after the URI launch and can be completely replaced by the target app. This property only specifies the preferred window size of the calling app. It doesn't specify the behavior of other apps that may happen to also be on screen at the same time.\n\n**Note**  Windows takes into account multiple different factors when it determines the source app's final window size, for example, the preference of the source app, the number of apps on screen, the screen orientation, and so on. By setting [**DesiredRemainingView**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn298314), you aren't guaranteed a specific windowing behavior for the source app.\n\n \n\n```cs\n// Set the desired remaining view.\nvar options = new Windows.System.LauncherOptions();\noptions.DesiredRemainingView = Windows.UI.ViewManagement.ViewSizePreference.UseLess;\n\n// Launch the URI\nvar success = await Windows.System.Launcher.LaunchUriAsync(uriContoso, options);\n```\n\n## Windows Maps app URI schemes\n\n\nYour app can use the **bingmaps:**, **ms-drive-to:**, and **ms-walk-to:** URI schemes to [launch the Windows Maps app](launch-maps-app.md) to specific maps, directions, and search results. For example, the following URI opens the Windows Maps app and displays a map centered over New York City.\n\n`bingmaps:?cp=40.726966~-74.006076`\n\n![an example of the windows maps app.](images/mapnyc.png)\n\nFor more info, see [Launch the Windows Maps app](launch-maps-app.md). To use the map control in your own app, see [Display maps with 2D, 3D, and Streetside views](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt219695).\n\n## Windows Settings app URI scheme\n\n\nYour app can use the **ms-settings:** URI scheme to [launch the Windows Settings app](launch-settings-app.md).
