The approaches you can take depend on the type of app you are working on (game, lifestyle, enterprise, and so on) and how far along you are in the development process. For example, a completed or nearly completed game that is heavily dependent on OpenGL or Cocos2D is an ideal candidate for the [Windows Bridge for iOS](https://dev.windows.com/bridges/ios), whereas if you are planning a cross-platform app for a small business, you should be considering using [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms). And if you have written your app in a cross-platform tool such as Unity, [publishing to Windows](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/09/09/windows-10-universal-apps-in-unity-5-2/) is quite straightforward.\n\n## Why Windows?\n\nToday, Windows is running on a huge number of devices. The UWP provides developers with a set of modern APIs, designed to create beautifully responsive user interfaces across devices as diverse as desktop computers, games consoles and holographic displays. With one Visual Studio solution, and with user interface controls that are smart enough to automatically optimize themselves for multiple platforms , you'll often find that you are writing less code and running it on more hardware.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://hubs-video.ssl.catalog.video.msn.com/embed/019d3337-80cf-4817-b50a-58f9463a4d27/IA?csid=ux-en-us&MsnPlayerLeadsWith=html&PlaybackMode=Inline&MsnPlayerDisplayShareBar=false&MsnPlayerDisplayInfoButton=false&iframe=true&QualityOverride=HD\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" frameBorder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\">Porting your Android or iOS app to Windows and Windows Phone</iframe>\n\n\n\n| Topic | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Selecting an approach to iOS and UWP app development](selecting-an-approach-to-ios-and-uwp-app-development.md) | What are the choices when developing cross-platform apps? |\n| [Getting started with UWP for iOS developers](getting-started-with-uwp-for-ios-developers.md) | If you're an iOS developer considering developing for Windows 10, these docs are a great place to start. |\n| [Setting up your Mac with Windows 10](setting-up-your-mac-with-windows-10.md) | Use your current Mac computer to develop apps for Windows. |\n\n## Related topics\n\n**For designers and developers**\n* [Building Universal Windows apps for all Windows devices](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=397871)\n* [Download design assets for Windows Store apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/bg125377.aspx)\n \n"}
