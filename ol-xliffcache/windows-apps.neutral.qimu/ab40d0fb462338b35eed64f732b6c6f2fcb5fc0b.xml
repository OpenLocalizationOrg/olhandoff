For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nWelcome to the Windows 10 game development guide!\n\nThis guide provides an end-to-end collection of the resources and information you'll need to develop a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) game.\n\n## Introduction to game development for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)\n\n\nWhen you create a Windows 10 game, you have the opportunity to reach millions of players worldwide across phone, PC, and Xbox One. With Xbox on Windows, Xbox Live, cross-device multiplayer, an amazing gaming community, and powerful new features like the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and DirectX 12, Windows 10 games thrill players of all ages and genres. The new Universal Windows Platform (UWP) delivers compatibility for your game across Windows 10 devices with a common API for phone, PC, and Xbox One, along with tools and options to tailor your game to each device experience.\n\nThis guide provides an end-to-end collection of information and resources that will help you as you develop your game. The sections are organized according to the stages of game development, so you'll know where to look for information when you need it.\n\nTo get started, the [Game development resources](#resources) section provides a high-level survey of documentation, programs, and other resources that are helpful when creating a game.\n\nThis guide will be updated as additional Windows 10 game development resources and material become available.\n\n## Game development resources\n\n\nFrom documentation to developer programs, forums, blogs, and samples, there are many resources available to help you on your game development journey. Here's a roundup of resources to know about as you begin developing your Windows 10 game.\n\n> **Note**   Xbox One development and select Windows 10 gaming features (Xbox Live Services, for example) are managed through programs such as ID@Xbox and Microsoft Studios. This guide covers a broad range of resources, so you may find that some resources are inaccessible depending on the program you are in or your specific development role. Examples are links that resolve to developer.xboxlive.com, forums.xboxlive.com, xdi.xboxlive.com, or the Game Developer Network (GDN). For information about partnering with Microsoft, see [Developer Programs](#programs).\n\n \n\n### Game development documentation\n\nThroughout this guide, you'll find deep links to relevant documentationâ€”organized by task, technology, and stage of game development.

The path you take depends on the type of game youâ€™re developing, the experience and preferences of your development studio, and specific feature requirements of your game. Will you use C#, C++, or JavaScript? DirectX, XAML, or HTML5?\n\n### DirectX\n\nMicrosoft DirectX is the choice to make for the highest-performance 2D and 3D graphics and multimedia. Direct3D 12, new in Windows 10, brings the power of a console-like API and is faster and more efficient than ever before. Your game can fully utilize modern graphics hardware and feature more objects, richer scenes, and enhanced effects. Direct3D 12 delivers optimized graphics on Windows 10 PCs and Xbox One. If you want to use the familiar graphics pipeline of Direct3D 11, youâ€™ll still benefit from the new rendering and optimization features added to Direct3D 11.3. And, if youâ€™re a tried-and-true desktop Windows API developer with roots in Win32, youâ€™ll still have that option in Windows 10.\n\nThe extensive features and deep platform integration of DirectX provide the power and performance needed by the most demanding games.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>How-to guides for DirectX games</td>\n        <td>[Games and DirectX](index.md)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>DirectX overviews and reference</td>\n        <td>[DirectX Graphics and Gaming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee663274)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Direct3D 12 programming guide and reference</td>\n        <td>[Direct3D 12 Graphics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn903821)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### XAML\n\nXAML is an easy-to-use declarative UI language with convenient features like animations, storyboards, data binding, scalable vector-based graphics, dynamic resizing, and scene graphs. XAML works great for game UI, menus, sprites, and 2D graphics. To make UI layout easy, XAML is compatible with design and development tools like Expression Blend and Microsoft Visual Studio. XAML is commonly used with C#, but C++ is also a good choice if thatâ€™s your preferred language or if your game has high CPU demands.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>XAML platform overview</td>\n        <td>[XAML platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt228259)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>XAML UI and controls</td>\n        <td>[Controls, layouts, and text](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt228348)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### HTML 5\n\nHyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a common UI markup language used for web pages, apps, and rich clients. Windows games can use HTML5 as a full-featured presentation layer with the familiar features of HTML, access to the Universal Windows Platform, and support for modern web features like AppCache, Web Workers, canvas, drag-and-drop, asynchronous programming, and SVG. Behind the scenes, HTML rendering takes advantage of the power of DirectX hardware acceleration, so you can still get the performance benefits of DirectX without writing any extra code. HTML5 is a good choice if you are proficient with web development, porting a web game, or want to use language and graphics layers that can be easier to approach than the other choices. HTML5 is used with JavaScript, but can also call into components created with C# or C++/CX.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>HTML5 and Document Object Model information</td>\n        <td>[HTML and DOM reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br212882.aspx)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>The HTML5 W3C Recommendation</td>\n        <td>[HTML5](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=221374)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### Combining presentation technologies\n\nThe Microsoft DirectX Graphics Infrastructure (DXGI) provides interop and compatibility across multiple graphics technologies. For high-performance graphics, you can combine XAML and DirectX, using XAML for menus and other simple UI, and DirectX for rendering complex 2D and 3D scenes. DXGI also provides compatibility between Direct2D, Direct3D, DirectWrite, DirectCompute, and the Microsoft Media Foundation.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>DirectX Graphics Infrastructure programming guide and reference</td>\n        <td>[DXGI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh404534)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Combining DirectX and XAML</td>\n        <td>[DirectX and XAML interop](directx-and-xaml-interop.md)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### C++\n\nC++/CX is a high-performance, low overhead language that provides the powerful combination of speed, compatibility, and platform access. C++/CX makes it easy to use all of the great gaming features in Windows 10, including DirectX and Xbox Live. You can also reuse existing C++ code and libraries. C++/CX creates fast, native code that doesnâ€™t incur the overhead of garbage collection, so your game can have great performance and low power consumption, which leads to longer battery life. Use C++/CX with DirectX or XAML, or create a game that uses a combination of both.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>C++/CX reference and overviews</td>\n        <td>[Visual C++ Language Reference (C++/CX)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh699871.aspx)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Visual C++ programming guide and reference</td>\n        <td>[Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2015](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/60k1461a.aspx)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### C#\n\nC# (pronounced \"C sharp\") is a modern, innovative language that is simple, powerful, type-safe, and object-oriented. C# enables rapid development while retaining the familiarity and expressiveness of C-style languages. Though easy to use, C# has numerous advanced language features like polymorphism, delegates, lambdas, closures, iterator methods, covariance, and Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions. C# is an excellent choice if you are targeting XAML, want to get a quick start developing your game, or have previous C# experience. C# is used primarily with XAML, so if you want to use DirectX, choose C++ instead, or write part of your game as a C++ component that interacts with DirectX. Or, consider [Win2D](https://github.com/Microsoft/Win2D), an immediate mode Direct2D graphics libary for C# and C++.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>C# programming guide and reference</td>\n        <td>[C# language reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/kx37x362.aspx)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is a dynamic scripting language widely used for modern web and rich client applications.\n\nWindows JavaScript apps can access the powerful features of the Universal Windows Platform in an easy, intuitive wayâ€”as methods and properties of object-oriented JavaScript classes. JavaScript is a good choice for your game if youâ€™re coming from a web development environment, are already familiar with JavaScript, or want to use HTML5, CSS, WinJS, or JavaScript libraries. If youâ€™re targeting DirectX or XAML, choose C# or C++/CX instead.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>JavaScript and Windows Runtime reference</td>\n        <td>[JavaScript reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj613794)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### Use Windows Runtime Components to combine languages\n\nWith the Universal Windows Platform, itâ€™s easy to combine components written in different languages. Create Windows Runtime Components in C++, C#, or Visual Basic, and then call into them from JavaScript, C#, C++, or Visual Basic. This is a great way to program portions of your game in the language of your choice. Components also let you consume external libraries that are only available in a particular language, as well as use legacy code youâ€™ve already written.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>How to create Windows Runtime Components</td>\n        <td>[Creating Windows Runtime Components](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh441572.aspx)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### Which version of DirectX should your game use?\n\nIf you are choosing DirectX for your game, you'll need to decide which version to use: Microsoft Direct3D 12 or Microsoft Direct3D 11.\n\nDirect3D 11.3 is a low level graphics API that uses the familiar Direct3D programming model. Direct3D 11 is still an option for a Universal Windows app, and you'll have access to the new rendering and optimization features added in Direct3D 11.3.\n\nDirect3D 12 is new in Windows 10 and introduces a new pipeline programming model. Direct3D 12 is closer to the hardware, uses less abstraction, and gives your game better control over resource use. Direct3D 12 has better CPU, GPU, and power performance.\n\nIf you have an existing engine written in Direct3D 11, and you're not quite ready to make the jump to Direct3D 12, you can use Direct3D 11 on 12 to achieve some performance improvements and begin your transition to Direct3D 12.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Choosing Direct3D 12 or Direct3D 11</td>\n        <td>[What is Direct3D 12?](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn899228)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Overview of Direct3D 11</td>\n        <td>[Direct3D 11 Graphics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff476080)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Overview of Direct3D 11 on 12</td>\n        <td>[Direct3D 11 on 12](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn913195)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n### Bridges, game engines, and middleware\n\nDepending on the needs of your game, using bridges, game engines, or middleware can save development and testing time and resources.

At its core, your game is a Universal Windows Platform app, so that's where you'll begin.\n\n### Introduction to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP)\n\nWindows 10 introduces the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), which provides a common API platform across Windows 10 devices. UWP evolves and expands the Windows Runtime model and hones it into a cohesive, unified core. Games that target the UWP can call WinRT APIs that are common to all devices. Because the UWP provides a guaranteed core API layer, you can choose to create a single app package that will install across Windows 10 devices. And if you want to, your game can still call APIs (including some classic Windows APIs from Win32 and .NET) that are specific to the devices your game runs on.\n\nThe goal of the UWP is to have:\n\n-   One core operating system\n-   One application platform\n-   One gaming social network\n-   One store\n-   One ingestion path\n\nThe following are excellent guides that discuss the Universal Windows Platform apps in detail, and are recommended reading to help you understand the platform.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Introduction to Universal Windows Platform apps</td>\n        <td>[What's a Universal Windows Platform app?](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn726767)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Overview of the UWP</td>\n        <td>[Guide to UWP apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn894631)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### Getting started with UWP development\n\nGetting set up and ready to develop a Universal Windows Platform app is quick and easy.

Games succeed when thoughtful design is applied to both aspectsâ€”when should your game use tested UX, and when should it diverge and innovate? The presentation technology that you choose for your gameâ€”DirectX, XAML, HTML5, or some combination of the threeâ€”will influence implementation details, but the design principles you apply are largely independent of that choice.\n\nSeparately from UX design, gameplay design such as level design, pacing, world design, and other aspects is an art form of its ownâ€”one that's up to you and your team, and not covered in this development guide.\n\n<table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <tr>\n        <td>UWP design basics and guidelines</td>\n        <td>[Designing UWP apps](https://dev.windows.com/design)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Designing for app lifecycle states</td>\n        <td>[UX guidelines for launch, suspend, and resume](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn611862)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Targeting multiple device form factors (video)</td>\n        <td>[Designing Games for a Windows Core World](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GDC/GDC-2015/Designing-Games-for-a-Windows-Core-World)</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n \n\n### Color guideline and palette\n\nFollowing a consistent color guideline in your game improves aesthetics, aids navigation, and is a powerful tool to inform the player of menu and HUD functionality.
