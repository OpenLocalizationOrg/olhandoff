finger that is detected by a touch digitizer. The larger, more complex set of input data reported by the digitizer is used to increase precision when determining the user's intended (or most likely) target.\n\n**Important APIs**\n\n-   [**Windows.UI.Core**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208383)\n-   [**Windows.UI.Input**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242084)\n-   [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Input**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227994)\n\n\n\nThis topic describes the use of contact geometry for touch targeting and provides best practices for targeting in UWP apps.\n\n## <span id=\"Measurements_and_scaling\"></span><span id=\"measurements_and_scaling\"></span><span id=\"MEASUREMENTS_AND_SCALING\"></span>Measurements and scaling\n\n\nTo remain consistent across different screen sizes and pixel densities, all target sizes are represented in physical units (millimeters). Physical units can be converted to pixels by using the following equation:\n\nPixels = Pixel Density × Measurement\n\nThe following example uses this formula to calculate the pixel size of a 9 mm target on a 135 pixel per inch (PPI) display at a 1x scaling plateau:\n\nPixels = 135 PPI × 9 mm\n\nPixels = 135 PPI × (0.03937 inches per mm × 9 mm)\n\nPixels = 135 PPI × 0.35433 inches\n\nPixels = 48 pixels\n\nThis result must be adjusted according to each scaling plateau defined by the system.\n\n## <span id=\"Thresholds\"></span><span id=\"thresholds\"></span><span id=\"THRESHOLDS\"></span>Thresholds\n\n\nDistance and time thresholds may be used to determine the outcome of an interaction.\n\nFor example, when a touch-down is detected, a tap is registered if the object is dragged less than 2.7 mm from the touch-down point and the touch is lifted within 0.1 second or less of the touch-down. Moving the finger beyond this 2.7 mm threshold results in the object being dragged and either selected or moved (for more information, see [Guidelines for cross-slide](guidelines-for-cross-slide.md)). Depending on your app, holding the finger down for longer than 0.1 second may cause the system to perform a self-revealing interaction (for more information, see [Guidelines for visual feedback](guidelines-for-visualfeedback.md#selfreveal)).\n\n## <span id=\"Target_sizes\"></span><span id=\"target_sizes\"></span><span id=\"TARGET_SIZES\"></span>Target sizes\n\n\nIn general, set your touch target size to 9 mm square or greater (48x48 pixels on a 135 PPI display at a 1.0x scaling plateau).

Some of the considerations that went into these recommendations include:\n\n-   Frequency of Touches: Consider making targets that are repeatedly or frequently pressed larger than the minimum size.\n-   Error Consequence: Targets that have severe consequences if touched in error should have greater padding and be placed further from the edge of the content area.
