Aside from making your app the best it can be, there are things you can do that make it easy for the Windows Store and other sites to showcase your app and help it get more attention.\n\n## Windows Store requirements for featured apps\n\n\nThe Windows Store showcases different apps grouped by category or theme. There are too many great apps to feature them all, and there is no way to guarantee your app will get selected. However, there are some things you can do to make sure your app is eligible to be considered for promotion in the Store.\n\n-   **Include great screenshots and promo images**\n\n    When featuring apps, the Windows Store may use your [app screenshots and images](app-screenshots-and-images.md) in various layouts. Be sure to design great screenshots that represent your app, and make sure the first screenshot is especially representative and appealing.\n\n    To maximize your app's chance of getting featured in the Store, you'll also need to provide at least one promotional image in your app's submission. Providing the 2400 x 1200 pixel size is most important, as we can use that image in a number of ways in the Store for Windows 10 customers. Keep in mind that we may crop this image in some layouts, so the center of the picture should contain your app's key visual elements and branding/logo. You may also want to provide additional image sizes if your app runs on earlier OS versions. For more details and guidelines, see [Promotional artwork](app-screenshots-and-images.md#promotional-artwork).\n\n-   **Build one version of your app, not one free version and a distinct paid version**\n\n    Rather than publishing separate free and paid versions of the same app, offer a free trial version for your paid app, or make it a free app with in-app purchases available to add enhanced functionality. This way your app will have one listing that works for all users: those only interested in free downloads, and those who might be ready to make a purchase.\n\n-   **Enable filters for apps containing 16+ and 18+ content**\n\n    In most cases the Windows Store doesn't consider featuring apps with 16+ content, unless the app uses content filtering so that any content that is only appropriate for age 16+ is hidden from users until they explicitly choose to show it. The content filter should be turned on by default, it should be password protected, and it should be available in the app itself (not on a separate website).\n\n-   **List your app in all relevant markets and languages**\n\n    Submitting your app to all relevant [markets](define-pricing-and-market-selection.md) can help you get broader coverage for your app. Of course, you'll want to make sure that your app is appropriate and meets all local guidelines for the markets you choose. Localizing your app's content into as many [languages](supported-languages.md) as possible can also help.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will also make it easier for others to promote your app in reviews, social media, or other venues.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
