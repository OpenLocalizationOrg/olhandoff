If you'd like to use a customized description for a specific operating system, you can [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md).\n\n## Description languages\n\nYou must complete the **Description** page for at least one language. We recommend providing a description in each language that your packages support, but you have flexibility to remove languages for which you don’t wish to provide a description. You can also provide descriptions in additional languages which aren’t supported by your packages.\n\n> Note  If your submission includes packages already, we’ll show the [languages](supported-languages.md) supported in your packages on the submission overview page (unless you remove any of them).\n\nTo add or remove languages for your descriptions, click **Manage description languages** from the submission overview page.

The sections of the **Description** page are described below.\n\n## Default description fields\n\n\nAt the top of the **Description** page, we show you the fields associated with your **Default description**. These fields will be shown to all of your customers, unless you [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md). If you do so, you'll see these fields repeated under section headings for each targeted OS for which you've created a platform-specific description, underneath your **Default description** (which will be displayed to customers on Windows 10, as well as customers on any OS that your app supports for which you haven't created a custom description).

This field has a 1500 character limit.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nIn most cases, you'll see multiple fields to provide screenshots for different types of devices. You are not required to provide separate screenshots for each device type; only one screenshot is required for your submission (though you can provide up to nine per device type). In most cases we suggest providing screenshots on as many device types as your app supports, so that customers will see images that resemble how the app will look on their device.\n\nFor more info, see [App screenshots and images](app-screenshots-and-images.md).\n\n### App tile icon\n\nThe app tile icon is used when displaying your app's listing to customers on Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier (and is used in your app's listing for customers on Windows 10 if you only have packages targeting Windows Phone 8.1 or earlier).
