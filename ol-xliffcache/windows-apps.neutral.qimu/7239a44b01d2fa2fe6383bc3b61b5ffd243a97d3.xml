You can use your component in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps with C++, JavaScript, Visual Basic, or C#. This article outlines the rules for creating a component, and discusses some aspects of .NET Framework support for the Windows Runtime. In general, that support is designed to be transparent to the .NET Framework programmer. However, when you create a component to use with JavaScript or C++, you need to be aware of differences in the way those languages support the Windows Runtime. |\n| [Walkthrough: Creating a Simple Windows Runtime component and calling it from JavaScript](walkthrough-creating-a-simple-windows-runtime-component-and-calling-it-from-javascript.md) | This walkthrough shows how you can use the .NET Framework with Visual Basic or C# to create your own Windows Runtime types, packaged in a Windows Runtime component, and how to call the component from your Universal Windows app built for Windows using JavaScript. |\n| [Raising Events in Windows Runtime components](raising-events-in-windows-runtime-components.md) | If your Windows Runtime component raises an event of a user-defined delegate type on a background thread (worker thread) and you want JavaScript to be able to receive the event, you can implement and/or raise it in one of these ways: |\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
