The panning interaction is most similar to rotating the mouse wheel or sliding the scroll box, rather than clicking the scroll bar. Unless a distinction is made in an API or required by some device-specific Windows UI, we simply refer to both interactions as panning.\n\nDepending on the input device, the user pans within a pannable region by using one of these:\n\n-   A mouse, touchpad, or active pen/stylus to click the scroll arrows, drag the scroll box, or click within the scroll bar.\n-   The wheel button of the mouse to emulate dragging the scroll box.\n-   The extended buttons (XBUTTON1 and XBUTTON2), if supported by the mouse.\n-   The keyboard arrow keys to emulate dragging the scroll box or the page keys to emulate clicking within the scroll bar.\n-   Touch, touchpad, or passive pen/stylus to slide or swipe the fingers in the desired direction.\n\nSliding involves moving the fingers slowly in the panning direction. This results in a one-to-one relationship, where the content pans at the same speed and distance as the fingers. Swiping, which involves rapidly sliding and lifting the fingers, results in the following physics being applied to the panning animation:\n\n-   Deceleration (inertia): Lifting the fingers causes panning to start decelerating. This is similar to sliding to a stop on a slippery surface.\n-   Absorption: Panning momentum during deceleration causes a slight bounce-back effect if either a snap point or a content area boundary is reached.\n\n**Types of panning**\n\nWindows 8 supports three types of panning:\n\n-   Single axis - panning is supported in one direction only (horizontal or vertical).\n-   Rails - panning is supported in all directions. However, once the user crosses a distance threshold in a specific direction, then panning is restricted to that axis.\n-   Freeform - panning is supported in all directions.\n\n**Panning UI**\n\nThe interaction experience for panning is unique to the input device while still providing similar functionality.\n\n**Pannable regions**\nPannable region behaviors are exposed to Windows Store app using JavaScript developers at design time through Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).\n\nThere are two panning display modes based on the input device detected:\n\n-   Panning indicators for touch.\n-   Scroll bars for other input devices, including mouse, touchpad, keyboard, and stylus.\n\n**Note**  Panning indicators are only visible when the touch contact is within the pannable region. Similarly, the scroll bar is only visible when the mouse cursor, pen/stylus cursor, or keyboard focus is within the scrollable region.\n\n \n\n**Panning indicators**\nPanning indicators are similar to the scroll box in a scroll bar. They indicate the proportion of displayed content to total pannable area and the relative position of the displayed content in the pannable area.\n\nThe following diagram shows two pannable areas of different lengths and their panning indicators.\n\n![image showing two pannable areas of different lengths and their panning indicators.](images/scrolling-indicators.png)\n\n**Panning behaviors**\n**Snap points**\nPanning with the swipe gesture introduces inertia behavior into the interaction when the touch contact is lifted. With inertia, the content continues to pan until some distance threshold is reached without direct input from the user. Use snap points to modify this inertia behavior.\n\nSnap points specify logical stops in your app content. Cognitively, snap points act as a paging mechanism for the user and minimize fatigue from excessive sliding or swiping in large pannable regions. With them, you can handle imprecise user input and ensure a specific subset of content or key information is displayed in the viewport.\n\nThere are two types of snap-points:\n\n-   Proximity - After the contact is lifted, a snap point is selected if inertia stops within a distance threshold of the snap point. Panning can still stop between proximity snap points.\n-   Mandatory - The snap point selected is the one that immediately precedes or succeeds the last snap point crossed before the contact was lifted (depending on the direction and velocity of the gesture). Panning must stop on a mandatory snap point.\n\nPanning snap-points are useful for applications such as web browsers and photo albums that emulate paginated content or have logical groupings of items that can be dynamically regrouped to fit within a viewport or display.\n\nThe following diagrams show how panning to a certain point and releasing causes the content to automatically pan to a logical location.\n\n|                                                                |                                                                                         |                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ![image showing a pannable area.](images/ux-panning-snap1.png) | ![image showing a pannable area being panned to the left.](images/ux-panning-snap2.png) | ![image showing a pannable area that has stopped panning at a logical snap-point.](images/ux-panning-snap3.png) |\n| Swipe to pan.                                                  | Lift touch contact.                                                                     | Pannable region stops at the snap point, not where the touch contact was lifted.                                |\n\n \n\n**Rails**\nContent can be wider and taller than the dimensions and resolution of a display device. For this reason, two-dimensional panning (horizontal and vertical) is often necessary. Rails improve the user experience in these cases by emphasizing panning along the axis of motion (vertical or horizontal).\n\nThe following diagram demonstrates the concept of rails.\n\n![diagram of a screen with rails that constrain panning](images/ux-panning-rails.png)\n\n**Chaining embedded or nested content**\n\nAfter a user hits a zoom or scroll limit on an element that has been nested within another zoomable or scrollable element, you can specify whether that parent element should continue the zooming or scrolling operation begun in its child element. This is called zoom or scroll chaining.\n\nChaining is used for panning within a single-axis content area that contains one or more single-axis or freeform panning regions (when the touch contact is within one of these child regions). When the panning boundary of the child region is reached in a specific direction, panning is then activated on the parent region in the same direction.\n\nWhen a pannable region is nested inside another pannable region it's important to specify enough space between the container and the embedded content. In the following diagrams, one pannable region is placed inside another pannable region, each going in perpendicular directions. There is plenty of space for users to pan in each region.\n\n![image demonstrating an embedded pannable area.](images/scrolling-embedded.png)\n\nWithout enough space, as shown in the following diagram, the embedded pannable region can interfere with panning in the container and result in unintentional panning in one or more of the pannable regions.\n\n![image demonstrating insufficient padding for an embedded pannable area.](images/ux-panning-embedded-wrong.png)\n\nThis guidance is also useful for apps such as photo albums or mapping apps that support unconstrained panning within an individual image or map while also supporting single-axis panning within the album (to the previous or next images) or details area. In apps that provide a detail or options area corresponding to a freeform panning image or map, we recommend that the page layout start with the details and options area as the unconstrained panning area of the image or map might interfere with panning to the details area.\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related articles\n\n\n* [Custom user interactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185599)\n* [Optimize ListView and GridView](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt204776)\n* [Keyboard accessibility](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt244347)\n\n**Samples**\n* [Basic input sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=620302)\n* [Low latency input sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=620304)\n* [User interaction mode sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=619894)\n* [Focus visuals sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=619895)\n\n**Archive samples**\n* [Input: XAML user input events sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=226855)\n* [Input: Device capabilities sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231530)\n* [Input: Touch hit testing sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231590)\n* [XAML scrolling, panning, and zooming sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=251717)\n* [Input: Simplified ink sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=246570)\n* [Input: Windows 8 gestures sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=264995)\n* [Input: Manipulations and gestures (C++) sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231605)\n* [DirectX touch input sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=231627)\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
