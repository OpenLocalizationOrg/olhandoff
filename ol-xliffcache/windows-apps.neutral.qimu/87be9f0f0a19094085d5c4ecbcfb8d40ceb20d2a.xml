UI and user experience guidelines for ads in apps\n\n---\n\n# UI and user experience guidelines for ads in apps\n\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n## General UI resources for Windows apps\n\nYou can find information about how to design the look and feel for apps at [Design & UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/design).\n\n## AdControl best practices\n\n* [AdControl best practices: DO](#adcontrolbestpracticesdo10)\n* [AdControl best practices: DON'T](#adcontrolbestpracticesdont10)\n\n<span id=\"adcontrolbestpracticesdo10\"/>\n### AdControl best practices: DO\n\n* Design advertising into your experience. Give your designers a sample ad to plan how the advertising is going to look. Two examples of well-planned ads in apps are the ads-as-content layout and the split layout.\n\n  To see how different ad sizes will look and function within your app, you can utilize our test mode ad units for Windows Phone, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. When you’re done with the test mode ad units, remember to [update your app with real ad unit IDs](set-up-ad-units-in-your-app.md) before submitting the app for certification.\n\n* Plan for times when no ads are available. There may be times when ads aren't being sent to your app. Lay out your pages in such a way that they look great whether they showcase an ad or not. For more information, see [Error handling](error-handling-with-advertising-libraries.md).\n\n<span id=\"adcontrolbestpracticesdont10\"/>\n### AdControl Best Practices: DON'T\n\n* Bolt advertising into open real estate. Ad space shouldn't be placed into the first open piece of real estate you can find. Instead, it should be incorporated into your app's overall design.\n\n* Over-advertise and saturate your app. Too many ads in your app detract from its appearance and usability. You want to make money with advertising, but not at the expense of the app itself.\n\n* Distract user from their core tasks. The primary focus should always be on the app. The ad space should be incorporated so it remains a secondary focus.\n\n<span id=\"interstitialbestpractices10\"/>\n## Interstitial best practices\n\n* [Interstitial best practices: DO](#interstitialbestpracticesdo10)\n* [Interstitial best practices: AVOID](#interstitialbestpracticesavoid10)\n* [Interstitial best practices: NEVER (Policy Enforced)](#interstitialbestpracticesnever10)\n\nWhen used elegantly, video interstitial ads can vastly increase your app revenue, without negatively impacting user satisfaction. When used improperly, such ads can have the exact opposite effect.\n\nHere we aim to help you achieve elegance. Since you know your app better than anyone, except where policy is concerned, we leave it up to you to make the best final decision. What’s most important to keep in mind is that your app ratings and revenue are tightly coupled.\n\n<span id=\"interstitialbestpracticesdo10\"/>\n### Interstitial best practices: DO\n\n* Fit interstitial ads within the natural flow of the app, such as between game levels.\n\n* Associate ads with tangible upsides, such as:\n\n    * Hints towards level completion.\n\n    * Extra time to retry a level.\n\n    * Custom avatar features, like a tattoo or hat.\n\n* If your app requires that a video ad be watched to completion, mention that rule upfront so they aren’t surprised with an error message upon hitting the close button.\n\n* Pre-fetch the ad (by calling [RequestAd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.interstitialad.requestad.aspx)) ideally 30-60 seconds before you need to show it.\n\n* Subscribe to all four events exposed in the [InterstitialAd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/microsoft.advertising.winrt.ui.interstitialad.aspx) class (**Canceled**, **Completed**, **AdReady**, and **ErrorOccurred**) and use them to make the right decisions for your app.\n\n* Have some built-in experience to use in lieu of a server-matched ad. You’ll find this useful in a few scenarios:\n\n    * Offline mode, when ad servers can’t be reached.\n\n    * When the **ErrorOccurred** event fires.\n\n    * If you opt to save user bandwidth based on [ConnectionProfile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.networking.connectivity.connectionprofile.aspx), there are APIs in the **ConnectionProfile** class which can help.\n\n* Use the default (30s) timeout unless you have a valid reason to do otherwise, in which case don’t go below 10s.\n\n    * Video ads take substantially longer to download than banners, especially in markets that don’t have high speed connections.\n\n\n* Be mindful of the user’s data plan.
