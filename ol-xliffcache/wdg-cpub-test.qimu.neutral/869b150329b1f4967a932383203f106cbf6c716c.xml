to Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), then this resource has all you need to map platform features—and your knowledge—between the three platforms.\n\nAlso see the porting content in [Move from iOS to UWP](ios-to-uwp-root.md).\n\n## User-interface (UI)\n\n|  **General concept** | **Android** | **iOS** | **Windows 10 UWP** |\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|  **Design language.** A set of conventions that prescribe how apps on the platform should look and behave. | **Android Material Design** guidelines provide a visual language for Android designers and developers to follow. | **Human Interface Guidelines** provide advice for iOS designers and developers. | [**UWP Windows Apps Design**](https://dev.windows.com/design) shows you how to create an app that looks fantastic on all Windows 10 devices. You will find user-interface (UI) design fundamentals, responsive design techniques, and a full list of detailed guidelines.<br/> |\n|  **User interface markup language.** A markup language that renders and describes a UI and its components. Each platform provides an editor for both visual and markup editing.<br/> | **XML layouts**, edited using **Android Studio** or **Eclipse**. | **XIB** and **Storyboards** edited using **Interface Builder** inside Xcode. | **[XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt185595.aspx)**, edited using **[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)** and **[Blend for Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj171012.aspx)**.<br/><br/>[XAML platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228259.aspx)<br/><br/>[Create a UI with XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228349.aspx)<br/><br/>[Define Layouts with XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228350.aspx) |\n|  **Built-in user interface controls.** Reusable UI elements provided by the platform such as buttons, list controls, and text controls. | Prebuilt **view** and **view group** classes referred to as widgets, layouts, text fields, containers, date/time controls and expert controls. | **Views** and **controls** found in the Xcode object library and listed in the UIKit user interface catalog. Views include image views, picker views and scroll views. Controls include buttons, date pickers and text fields. | The XAML platform provides you with a generous set of **built-in controls** such as buttons, list controls, panels, text controls, command bars, pickers, media, and inking.<br/><br/>[Add controls and handle events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228345.aspx) |\n|  **Control event-handling.** Defining the logic that runs when events are triggered within UI controls. | **Event handlers** and **event listeners** are added in XML or programmatically. | Controls send **action** messages to **targets**. | You can define methods to handle the events of a XAML control in a **code-behind file** attached to the XAML page. **Event handlers** are always written in code. But you can hook those handlers to events either in XAML markup or in code.<br/><br/>[Add controls and handle events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228345.aspx)<br/><br/>[Events and routed events overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt185584.aspx) |\n|  **Data binding.** A software design pattern that allows your app UI to render data and optionally stay in sync with that data.  | There is a **Data Binding Library** provided, although it is still in beta. | No built-in bindings system exists on iOS. **Key-value observing** can be built upon to perform data binding, either with the use of a third-party library, or writing additional code. Controls use a delegate/callback approach for obtaining data. | The UWP platform handles **data binding** for you. You use the **[{x:Bind}](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt204783.aspx)** markup extension to take advantage of high performance binding or **[{Binding}](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt204782.aspx)** to take advantage of more features. It’s then just a case of configuring your binding to choose whether the platform uses **one-way binding** to display values from a data source in your UI, or whether it also observes those values and updates your UI when they change with **two-way binding**.<br/><br/>[Data Binding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt210947.aspx) |\n|  **UI Automation.** Programmatic access to UI elements, making apps accessible to assistive technology products and enabling automated test scripts to interact with your UI. | **Text labels**, **contentDescription** and **hint** values help ensure UI elements can be found by automation. Android Studio allows you to write UI tests using the **UI Automator** and **Espresso** testing frameworks. | The **Automation instrument** allows you to write automated UI test scripts which identify elements using the **accessibility** settings or the element's position in the **element hierarchy**. | You get programmatic access to built-in UI elements in UWP out-of-box with **[UI Automation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/ee684076.aspx)**.<br/>**[Custom Automation Peers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt297667.aspx)** allow you to provide automation support for your own custom UI classes. The **[Coded UI Test Project](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd286726.aspx#VerifyingCodeUsingCUITCreate)** in Visual Studio allows you to automatically test your whole application through the UI, or to test the UI in isolation. |\n|  **Changing the appearance of a control.** Editing size, color and other attributes. | Controls have **properties** which can be edited using the designer tool, in XML markup or programmatically. | Controls have **attributes** which you can edit using the **Attributes Inspector** in Interface Builder or programmatically. | You can edit the **properties** of controls in the XAML markup or programmatically, using Visual Studio and Blend for Visual Studio.<br/><br/>[Add controls and handle events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228345.aspx) |\n|  **Reusable visual styles.** Apply visual changes to a number of controls, in a reusable format. | **XML styles** are sets of properties that are applied to one or more controls. | iOS does not support reusable visual styles out-of-box, but the UIAppearance protocol allows multiple controls to share common attributes. | You can create reusable **[styles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.style.aspx)**, which can be applied to multiple controls and stored in a **[ResourceDictionary](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.resourcedictionary.aspx)** for easy reuse.<br/><br/>[Quickstart: Styling Controls](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh465381.aspx) |\n|  **Editing the visual structure of controls.** Customize the visual structure of a control beyond just modifying properties or attributes, e.g. moving the checkbox text underneath the checkbox. | No simple method of editing the visual structure of controls exists in Android. | No simple method of editing the visual structure of controls exists in iOS. | To customize the visual structure of a control, you can copy and edit its **[control template](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.controltemplate.aspx)** in XAML markup.<br/><br/>[Quickstart: Control Templates](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh465374.aspx)  |\n|  **Built-in touch gestures.** Provide customized touch support by handling high level abstracted gesture events such as tap and double tap in views and controls. | **Gesture detectors** detect common touch gestures including scrolling, long-press, tap, double-tap and fling. | UIKit framework provides built-in **gesture recognizers** which detect touch gestures including tap, pinch, pan, swipe, rotate and long-press. | **UI elements** allow you to handle **static gesture events** including tap, double-tap, right-tap and holding, as well as **manipulation gesture events** including slide, swipe, turn, pinch and stretch. Gesture events are **routed events** and can be handled by parent objects containing the child UIElement.<br/><br/>[Touch interactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185617.aspx)<br/><br/>[Custom user interactions - gestures, manipulations, and interactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185599.aspx#gestures__manipulations__and_interactions) |\n\n## Navigation and app structure\n\n|  **General concept** | **Android** | **iOS** | **Windows 10** |\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|  **Layouts.** The layout defines the structure of the user interface. | Layout is composed of **view groups** such as the **LinearLayout** and the **RelativeLayout** which can nest other view groups or views. | Layout is composed of a **UIViewController** containing **UIView**'s which can be nested.  | XAML which provides a flexible layout system composed of **layout panel classes** such as **[Canvas](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.canvas.aspx)**, **[Grid](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.grid.aspx)**, **[RelativePanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.relativepanel.aspx)** and **[StackPanel](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.stackpanel.aspx)** for static and responsive layouts. **[Properties](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms171352.aspx)** are used to control the size and position of the elements.<br/><br/>[Define layouts with XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt228350.aspx)<br/> |\n|  **Peer-to-peer navigation.** Presenting the user with methods of navigating between pages of equal hierarchical importance. | **Tabs**, **swipe views** and **navigation drawers** provide **lateral navigation**. | **Tab bar controllers**, **split view controllers** and **page view controllers** allow navigation between views of equal hierarchy. | You can display a persistent list of links/tabs above the content using **[tabs/pivots](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn997788.aspx)**. The **[navigation pane/split view](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn997787.aspx)** lets you display a list of links alongside the content.<br/><br/>[Navigation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187344.aspx)<br/><br/>[Peer to peer navigation between two pages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt465735.aspx) |\n|  **Hierarchical navigation.** Navigating between parent and child pages of a hierarchy. | **Lists**, and **grid lists**, **buttons** and other controls provide **descendent navigation** when used with **intents** to load other **activities**. | **Navigation controllers** allow users to navigate between levels of a hierarchy. | **[Hubs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn449149.aspx)** let you show the user a preview of content which can be selected to navigate to child pages. **[Master/details](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn997765.aspx)** let users pick from a list of item summaries which display next to the corresponding detail section.<br/><br/>[Navigation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187344.aspx) |\n|  **Back button navigation.** Navigating back through an application. | The **back** and **up** buttons inside the action bar provide **ancestral** and **temporal** navigation using the **back stack**. | The **navigation controller** can have a back button added to it.<br/> | You can handle software or hardware back button presses easily using the **[back stack property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.frame.backstack.aspx)** which allows your users to traverse the **navigation history**.<br/><br/>[Back button navigation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt465734.aspx) |\n|  **Splash screen.** Showing an image on app launch, used primarily for branding. | Splash screens are not provided by default, and are implemented by editing the first activities **theme background**. | Apps must either have a **static launch image** or **XIB/storyboard launch file**. | You create a splash screen using an **image** and colored background. [Splash screen time can be extended](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187309.aspx).<br/><br/>[Add a splash screen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187306.aspx)<br/><br/>[Guidelines for splash screens](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465338.aspx) |\n\n## Custom inputs\n\n|  **General concept** | **Android** | **iOS** | **Windows 10** |\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|  **Voice.** Speech recognition for speech input, and additional voice capabilities. | Speech input can be provided by any app which implements a **RecognizerIntent**, such as **Google Voice Search**. The **SpeechRecognizer** class allows apps to use Google's speech recognition API. | No built-in speech recognition or speech input APIs exist. | You can use the **[speech recognition](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185615.aspx)** API to interact with your app in the foreground. You can use speech-based **[Cortana interactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185598.aspx)** to launch apps in the foreground or background, and to ​interact with background apps.<br/><br/>[Speech interactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185614.aspx) |\n|  **Custom user inputs.** Handling keyboard, mouse, stylus and other inputs. | Support for interactions includes **touch**, **touchpad**, **stylus**, **mouse** and **keyboard**. Movements and inputs are reported in the same way as touch, but it is possible to detect more information about the **input device**. | Support for **touch**, the **Apple Pencil** and hardware **keyboards** are provided. | You will find support for a wide range of interactions including **[touch](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185617.aspx)**, **[touchpad](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187313.aspx)**, **[pen/stylus](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187311.aspx)** with digital ink, **[mouse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187308.aspx)** and **[keyboard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185607.aspx)**. Your apps can handle the data without needing to know which input device was used, and raw input device data can be accessed if needed.<br/><br/>[Handle pointer input](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt404610.aspx)<br/><br/>[Custom user interactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt185599.aspx) |\n\n## Data\n\n|  **General concept** | **Android** | **iOS** | **Windows 10** |\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|  **Local app data.** Storing settings and files related to your app locally. | Local files can be saved using **openFileOutput** and **openFileInput**. Settings in a **shared preferences file** can be accessed using **getSharedPreferences**. | Local files can be stored in the **application support** directory, accessed via the **NSFileManager** class. Settings in **preferences** files can be accessed by the **NSUserDefaults** class. | The **[Windows.Storage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/br230562.aspx)** classes handle local data storage for you in a unified way.
